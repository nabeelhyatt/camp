                "text": " This is a common issue with context menus - the right-click event often causes the text selection to be cleared before the context menu appears. Here are a few ways to fix this:\n\n## Method 1: Prevent Selection Clearing on Right-Click\n\nAdd an event listener to prevent the default text deselection behavior:\n\n```javascript\n// Add this to your component or globally\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleContextMenu = (e) => {\n    // Prevent the default context menu and selection clearing\n    if (window.getSelection().toString()) {\n      e.preventDefault();\n    }\n  };\n\n  document.addEventListener('contextmenu', handleContextMenu);\n  return () => document.removeEventListener('contextmenu', handleContextMenu);\n}, []);\n```\n\n## Method 2: Capture Selection Before Context Menu\n\nStore the selection when the context menu is triggered:\n\n```javascript\nconst [selectedText, setSelectedText] = useState('');\n\nconst handleContextMenu = (e) => {\n  const selection = window.getSelection().toString();\n  if (selection) {\n    setSelectedText(selection);\n    // Now you can use selectedText in your context menu actions\n  }\n};\n\n// Apply to your trigger element\n<div onContextMenu={handleContextMenu}>\n  Your content here\n</div>\n```\n\n## Method 3: Use CSS to Maintain Selection\n\nAdd CSS to prevent selection from being cleared:\n\n```css\n.preserve-selection {\n  -webkit-user-select: text;\n  -moz-user-select: text;\n  -ms-user-select: text;\n  user-select: text;\n}\n\n.preserve-selection::selection {\n  background: #b3d4fc; /* Or your preferred selection color */\n}\n```\n\n## Method 4: Shadcn-Specific Solution\n\nIf you're using shadcn's ContextMenu, you can modify the trigger behavior:\n\n```jsx\n<ContextMenu>\n  <ContextMenuTrigger \n    onContextMenu={(e) => {\n      // Capture selection before menu opens\n      const selection = window.getSelection();\n      if (selection.rangeCount > 0) {\n        // Store the range to restore later if needed\n        const range = selection.getRangeAt(0);\n        // Store in ref or state for use in menu items\n      }\n    }}\n  >\n    Your content\n  </ContextMenuTrigger>\n  <ContextMenuContent>\n    {/* Your menu items */}\n  </ContextMenuContent>\n</ContextMenu>\n```\n\nThe most reliable approach is usually Method 2 - capturing the selected text when the context menu is triggered, since you'll likely want to use that text in your menu actions anyway (like \"Copy\", \"Cut\", etc.).\n\nWhich approach would work best for your specific use case?",

Los Angeles Immigration Protests and Federal Response**\nHundreds of U.S. Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area under orders from President Donald Trump to help quell ongoing protests against federal immigration raids. Tensions remain high for a fifth day of immigration protests in downtown LA, with California Governor Gavin Newsom reporting that an additional 2,000 National Guard troops are being sent to Los Angeles. The state of California is suing the Trump administration over the federal deployment.\n\n**2. RFK Jr. Removes CDC Vaccine Advisory Committee**\nHealth Secretary RFK Jr. has removed all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, saying the group has been \"plagued with persistent conflicts of interest\". He claims this action will help restore public trust in vaccines, though health officials have criticized the move.\n\n**3. US-China Trade Talks Continue**\nGlobal stocks and the dollar held steady as trade talks between the United States and China continued into a second day, giving investors some reason to believe tensions between the world's two largest economies may be easing. Markets are watching these discussions closely.\n\n**4. Trump Travel Ban Takes Effect**\nA new travel ban from the Trump administration, which revives a controversial measure from Trump's first term, took effect Monday morning. The policy affects multiple countries and has drawn responses from foreign leaders.\n\n**5. Warner Bros. Discovery Corporate Split**\nWarner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, separating streaming and studios from its cable channels. The company has been burdened by debt and the decline of cable TV.\n\nThese stories reflect ongoing domestic tensions around immigration policy, significant health policy changes, international trade developments, and major corporate restructuring in the entertainment industry.",

The Trump White House wants to reduce the $25 billion allocation for the space agency by 24 percent.\n\nOn Wall Street today, stocks managed some modest gains to start the new trading month. The Dow Jones industrial average added just 35 points on the day. The Nasdaq rose nearly 130 points. The S&P 500 also finished in positive territory. And we have a good news/bad news story from the world of astronomy. On the one hand, according to a Finnish team of scientists writing in the journal \"Nature Astronomy,\" there's a 50/50 chance that the Milky Way will collide with the Andromeda galaxy in the next 10 billion years. That's represented on the bottom of this composite image showing the various scenarios. On the other hand, that's actually less likely than previously thought, or, as the astronomers put it -- quote -- \"As it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated.\" Still to come on the \"News Hour\": Congress wrangles over the president's legislative agenda; and Tamara Keith and Amy Walter break down the latest political headlines.\n\nToday's ruling doesn't answer if states can crack down on such weapons. Similar challenges are playing out in lower courts, and just as Brett Kavanaugh says the Supreme Court -- quote -- \"will address the AR-15 issue soon in the next term or two.\" The justices also declined to hear a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on high-capacity gun magazines. In 2022, the state banned anyone from owning a magazine that carries more than 10 rounds of ammunition. In Canada, more than 100 wildfires have forced mass evacuations and sent smoke and unhealthy air deep into the U.S. At least 25,000 residents have fled the fires across the provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta. The blazes began last week and are being fueled by hot and dry weather. As the smoke spreads south, air quality in parts of North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin is worsening. In some areas, the air is rated as very unhealthy, the second worst category out of six.\n\nMILES O'BRIEN: It would be the largest single-year budget cut in NASA's storied history, including the early '70s, when the Apollo moon program was winding down. The Trump White House wants to reduce the $25 billion allocation for the space agency by 24 percent. Space science would be cut nearly in half. ADAM RIESS, Johns Hopkins University: That would be sort of, I won't say, almost extinction level for a lot of the space science that we pursue. MILES O'BRIEN: Adam Riess is a professor of physics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University. He and two colleagues won the Nobel Prize in physics for discovering the acceleration of our expanding universe. They used the Hubble space telescope, along with ground-based instruments, to collect their data. ADAM RIESS: I think people are awed and inspired by the mystery of space, what's out there. These are, in the scheme of things, relatively modest investments for us as humans to do this most ambitious thing, to try to understand the place in w\n\nThose sorts of stories are breaking through. I think that -- the analogy I think of with this is the Affordable Care Act, which was very unpopular. Obamacare was not a popular program until Republicans in Congress started taking action to take it away. And then, suddenly, as this battle raged, people learned about what the Affordable Care Act did, discovered that things that they liked were actually part of this Obamacare that they thought they disliked. And it became much more popular when there was a risk of it going away. AMNA NAWAZ: Amy, there's another part of the CNN poll I want to put to you about leadership. They asked if -- quote -- \"the party with strong leaders\" described either Democrats, Republicans, or neither; 40 percent of those polls said Republicans, 16 percent said Democrats, 43 percent said neither. But you wrote this week about Democrats being stuck in what you call a cringe trap.",

Los Angeles Immigration Protests and Federal Response**\nHundreds of U.S. Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area under orders from President Donald Trump to help quell ongoing protests against federal immigration raids. Tensions remain high for a fifth day of immigration protests in downtown LA, with California Governor Gavin Newsom reporting that an additional 2,000 National Guard troops are being sent to Los Angeles. The state of California is suing the Trump administration over the federal deployment.\n\n**2. RFK Jr. Removes CDC Vaccine Advisory Committee**\nHealth Secretary RFK Jr. has removed all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, saying the group has been \"plagued with persistent conflicts of interest\". He claims this action will help restore public trust in vaccines, though health officials have criticized the move.\n\n**3. US-China Trade Talks Continue**\nGlobal stocks and the dollar held steady as trade talks between the United States and China continued into a second day, giving investors some reason to believe tensions between the world's two largest economies may be easing. Markets are watching these discussions closely.\n\n**4. Trump Travel Ban Takes Effect**\nA new travel ban from the Trump administration, which revives a controversial measure from Trump's first term, took effect Monday morning. The policy affects multiple countries and has drawn responses from foreign leaders.\n\n**5. Warner Bros. Discovery Corporate Split**\nWarner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies, separating streaming and studios from its cable channels. The company has been burdened by debt and the decline of cable TV.\n\nThese stories reflect ongoing domestic tensions around immigration policy, significant health policy changes, international trade developments, and major corporate restructuring in the entertainment industry.",
