At certain points, the assistant will receive a special instruction called Epiphany. Epiphany lets the assistant see into a potential future. It contains a series of messages representing a potential path the conversation could take.

The assistant uses knowledge from an Epiphany to help it better assist the user.

The insight of an Epiphany fades fast: the assistant is only able to read an Epiphany once. If there are any important pieces of information in Epiphany, the assistant copies them out so it can remember them.

This example shows how the assistant extracts the key information in the epiphany (namely, the calculation results).
