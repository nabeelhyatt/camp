## Preface

The success of TEAM therapy (also known as TEAM CBT) in enabling high-speed medication-
free treatment of depression, anxiety and many other emotional challenges has led to a rapidly
growing interest in this new therapeutic approach. There are now multiple training groups
around the world that are ongoing and more that are being established. There are also book
clubs that focus on chapter-by-chapter discussions of _Feeling Great_ , the new book by David
Burns (creator of TEAM therapy).

What’s missing is a brief overview of TEAM therapy that enables people to quickly understand
what it is, how it differs from other therapies, and how to practice this approach. (By brief, I
mean something that can be read in a single evening, or less). That’s not a simple challenge.
Dr. Burns and his colleagues have recorded over 250 podcasts on TEAM therapy, and _Feeling
Great_ is 500 pages long. There are also 11 other books and countless articles by Dr. Burns, and
books and articles by multiple other researchers and therapists that are relevant to this topic.

Providing an overview of TEAM therapy that helps someone understand it quickly is already
challenging – but what makes the challenge even greater is that such a summary would be
more helpful if it could also help explain why TEAM therapy is so powerful. That explanation
requires understanding how this therapy works in terms of brain function. The only way any
successful treatment can work is if it’s aligned with the biology of the problem you’re trying to fix.
As we’re talking about emotions and habits of thinking, that means the biology of the brain^1.

Which brings us to this guide, which is written to be useful for the following groups of people:

- _If you’re having emotional problems and want to work with (or are working with) a TEAM_
    _therapist or with Feeling Great_ then this guide will help you understand what happens
    when you’re using this approach. If you’re like me, then heading towards a particular
    destination is a lot more enjoyable if you have some idea of the way to get there. By
    understanding both the relevant aspects of brain function (written so that you don’t need
    a college degree to understand them) and the steps in TEAM therapy, you’ll be able to
    make this approach even more effective for yourself. Moreover, I think you’ll find that
    what you’ll learn about your brain will be pretty interesting.
- _If you’re a therapist using TEAM therapy,_ this guide is written so that you can provide it
    to your clients as soon as you start working with them (or any time after that). That way,
    they’ll know what you’re trying to accomplish and why you’re doing what you do. That
    will make it easier for the two of you to work together.
- _If you’re learning TEAM therapy, or are curious about TEAM therapy_ , then I hope this
    guide will be helpful in understanding what’s special about this approach, why it’s so
    powerful, and how to get the most out of it.

The guide is in three parts:

- The first part (12 pages) is an overview of aspects of brain function that I think are
    needed to understand how TEAM therapy works, written so that you don’t need a

college degree to understand the key ideas. This section distills the most important
insights derived thus far in the journey to understand the neuroscience of high-speed
medication-free psychotherapy
If you understand how something works, you can make it more effective for
yourself. Why do you do this and not do that? Why is it important to do things in a
certain way and a certain order? The information in this first section will help you think
about such questions in ways that have been helpful to others.
```
- The second part (3 1 pages, including illustrations) is a guide to a typical treatment
    session. This section provides a grounding for exploring TEAM therapy in deeper and
    broader ways. It also defines the expectations for a session in TEAM therapy.
       TEAM therapy was developed through careful scientific analyses of what works and
    what doesn’t, over many years and many thousands of sessions with people with a wide
    range of needs. Every step in TEAM therapy has a purpose, and no steps can be left
    out. But what are those purposes? How do they fit together to enable high-speed
    recovery? These are some of the questions examined in this section.
- Finally, the last section is an attempt to answer some of the questions that come up
    frequently in discussions on TEAM therapy.

In addition, I’ve written a separate 25 - page guide that provides a more detailed analysis of the
Daily Mood Log (DML), a critical tool in carrying out TEAM therapy.^2 Understanding the DML
and how to use it is critical in conducting and in understanding TEAM therapy. The DML guide
is also available with the _Brain User’s Guide_ for your free download. If you’re interested in the
guide to the DML, I suggest reading this _User’s Guide_ first. This is because most of the
information on brain function referred to in the DML is in the _User’s Guide._

The goal of both of these guides is to make the most fundamental principles of TEAM therapy
easier to learn and to use for your own benefit. Just as for any skill, learning the basic principles
makes it much easier to learn more advanced techniques. The material in these guides will
transform your ability to learn from working with your therapist or with _Feeling Great_ , listening to
live sessions, or working in training groups. You now will have the background needed to
understand what’s happening at each stage of the therapeutic journey. You also have a guide
that allows you to easily re-visit any topic, whenever you need to do that.

Both of these guides are copyrighted under what’s called a Creative Commons License. That
basically means that the only thing you can’t do is copy them and put your name on them. Other
than that, these guides are intended to be freely available to all. If you’d like to translate one or
both of them into a different language, just let me know. I’d be happy to also change the text on
the illustrations if you send me translated text to use. It’s also okay if you want to come up with
new illustrations.

Whether you are working to improve your emotional state, are learning TEAM therapy as a
therapist, or are just curious about TEAM therapy, I hope that you find these guides useful. If
you have questions (or criticisms), please let me know.

With warm wishes to you all,

## An introduction to TEAM therapy.

Welcome to the TEAM team. TEAM stands for Testing, Empathy, Addressing resistance and
Methods.

TEAM therapy is a new approach to treating depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD and many other
emotional and psychological (including, e.g., problems, habits and addictions). This approach
brings together the most powerful tools from many different types of psychotherapy into a single
discipline. It also adds new techniques that are unique to TEAM therapy.

TEAM therapy is built to be useful for everyone dealing with emotional challenges. We all have
unique lives and unique brains, and what works best for someone else might not be the best
approach for you. One of the strengths of TEAM therapy is that it includes many powerful tools
that help your therapist respond to your personal needs, in the most effective ways for you.

The reason your therapist became an expert in TEAM therapy is because this approach is often
more effective than other treatments for depression, anxiety and many other problems. Even if
years of other treatments have not helped you, the TEAM approach can enable the emotional
recovery that you seek.

You can listen to examples of such successes yourself, as live treatment sessions found at the
links to [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com) provided at the end of this guide. You may find the examples
puzzling, however, because the live sessions sound like straightforward conversations. Yet,
these seemingly simple conversations cause the rapid recovery that is one of the goals of
TEAM therapy. How can this be?

When you listen to live sessions, the effectiveness of TEAM therapy can be so puzzling that it
sounds like magic. Perhaps that’s because, as the writer Arthur C. Clarke once wrote, “Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Although there’s no
electronic, biological or chemical technology in TEAM therapy, it’s an advanced technology of
the mind.

This guide describes what you can expect when you’re working with a TEAM therapist and also
provides some possible explanations for what’s happening at each step. With this information,
you’ll be able to understand what happens at every step of your own therapeutic journey. You’ll
also be able to understand every step in the live sessions available at [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com).

This guide is designed to be helpful for multiple groups of people:

- You may be new to the world of TEAM therapy, and puzzled why it’s so different from
    other treatments. The _User’s Guide_ will help you understand how TEAM therapy differs
    and what the purpose is of features unique to this approach.
- If you’re working with a therapist, or working on your own by doing the exercises in Dr.
    David Burns newest book (called _Feeling Great_ ), then knowing the purpose of each step
    will help you work more effectively towards recovery. Working with _Feeling Great_ (or
    Dr. Burns’ other books) can offer a powerful approach to improving your emotional life.
    This is even true for people who don’t have the option of working with a good therapist.
    The techniques you’ll need already are straightforward – and will hopefully be even more
    straightforward with the help of this guide.
- If you’re a therapist who’s studying TEAM therapy, this guide will hopefully make it
    easier to understand how the pieces of this approach fit together, The guide also will
    help you understand why it’s important to do things in certain ways.
- If you’re a therapist wondering if learning TEAM therapy is worth your interest, I hope the
    information in here will make you curious about learning more.


Perhaps you think the rapid recoveries that can be achieved with TEAM therapy are impossible
because “that’s not how the brain works.” The problem with such a belief is that such rapid
recoveries are being seen by therapists around the world who are using the TEAM approach.
Perhaps it’s worth considering a different perspective on brain function, such as that provided in
this _User’s Guide_.

One of the most wonderful discoveries about our brains is that changing unpleasant emotions is
easier than it feels when we’re in the midst of those emotions. This discovery is the basis for
some of the most effective therapies for emotional distress. Learning how to treat such distress
can be one of the most liberating experiences that you can have.

Finally, I want to be clear that the use of this guide is not meant to be a replacement for seeing
a therapist if you need one. If you’re in emotional trouble, then let someone know.

## Why would you care how TEAM therapy works?

```
It’s easier to work with your mind if you know how your mind works.
```
There are two kinds of treatments for health problems:

- For some therapies, your active participation is needed to get better. Psychotherapy
    and physical therapy are good examples of treatments like this.
- For other therapies, like taking an antibiotic for a bacterial infection, you don’t have to do
    much. Just take the pill, and let it do its job.

If a therapy requires your participation, you can make it even more effective if you understand
what you’re trying to accomplish. It’s true that TEAM therapy will work for you whether or not
you understand how it works. If you know what you’re doing at each step, however, you can
make TEAM therapy work even better.

Thus, there are several reasons why you might care how TEAM therapy works. For example:

- TEAM therapy is different from other therapies. Understanding how TEAM therapy works
    will help you see why those differences make the TEAM approach more successful.
- Understanding how TEAM therapy works will help you understand why this therapy can
    enable rapid recovery from depression and anxiety, even if years of working with other
    approaches have not helped.
- Every step in TEAM CBT is there because it’s important in enabling rapid recovery. By
    understanding the purpose of each step, you’ll be able to make each one even more
    powerful.
- Understanding how TEAM therapy works also will help you be more flexible in the way
    you approach therapy. As an analogy, let’s say that you’re trying to get to a particular
    destination and you know about all the possible roads and paths that you can use. If
    you have that knowledge, then you can still figure out how to get where you want to go
    even if one of the roads is blocked.
- Finally, understanding how TEAM therapy works will make it more enjoyable and more
    interesting.

With TEAM therapy, you’ll learn the skills you need to restore joy in your life.

By understanding how TEAM therapy works, you’ll also be able to make those skills even more
powerful.


## Approaching TEAM therapy from the perspective of brain function

All the benefits of TEAM therapy are possible because of the way this approach aligns with the
basic functions of your brain, the most remarkable part of your body. The brain is where all
your thoughts and feelings occur. It is the only part of your body that can decide to change itself

- such as the change you’re seeking when you decide to work with a therapist. It’s also the only
part of your body that can then create an action plan to do this, and can make that action plan
happen. No other part of your body can do the wonderful things that your brain can do.

For any therapy to work, it has to be aligned with the biology of what you’re trying to fix.
Antibiotics treat bacterial infections because they kill bacteria. But antibiotics don’t work for a
broken leg. And putting a cast on your leg won’t treat a bacterial infection. The biology of the
therapy has to be aligned with the biology of the problem.

The most effective approaches for restoring your emotional balance will be the ones that are
most aligned with the biology of emotions.

That biology is the biology of your brain.

## Part I: What’s going on in your brain?

In order for TEAM therapy (and CBT in general) to be able to treat the wide range of emotional
maladies for which they’re used, these approaches must work on principles of brain function so
fundamental that they apply to many different situations. Moreover, there do not appear to be
any cultural limitations in the utility of the techniques of CBT, so it’s important to think in terms of
brain functions that transcend gender, race, culture or anything else that varies in different
populations.

Several critical brain functions help make it easier to understand depression and anxiety, and
also help explain how TEAM therapy works and why it’s so effective.

### A. Your brain uses emotions to help keep you alive

Where do your emotions come from? Why do you have the emotions that you do? Knowing
how your emotions are generated can help you when they’re interfering with living a joyful life.

To carry out its most important function, which is helping keep you alive, your brain interprets
the world, predicts what’s going to happen and motivates you to act in a way that matches these
interpretations and predictions. _Those motivations are your emotions_.

The five steps your brain goes through when it interprets information, makes predictions and
generates emotions are:

Step 1. The brain receives information from inside the body and from the outside world.

Step 2. It interprets this information to make sense of what’s happening and to predict what’s
going to happen next (and what you need to do). Making predictions is one of the most
important brain functions. Interpreting information and making predictions occurs quickly and
takes place almost entirely at an unconscious level we don’t even notice.

Step 3. The brain next creates emotions as motivations that push you to respond so what you
do is aligned with your interpretations and predictions. This happens quickly and without


```
your conscious awareness. Emotions are not a conclusion you reach, like when you solve a
mathematics problem. Instead, they are rapid and unconscious reactions to your
interpretations and predictions. Whatever emotions you’re experiencing, the key to
understanding them is to identify the interpretations that cause them.
Emotions come in two basic types, and can motivate you to move towards something or
away from something:
```
- For example, your interpretations might predict that something will be enjoyable. If so,
    they’ll cause positive emotions, like pleasure, joy, enthusiasm, calm, curiosity,
    friendship, sexual attraction, or the feeling of being safe. When you have a positive
    emotion, it’s natural to want to experience more of whatever causes that emotion and
    to feel happy if you can do that.
- Your interpretations also might predict that something is going to be unpleasant. If so,
    they’ll cause negative emotions, like sadness, shame, guilt, feeling helpless or
    hopeless or alone or abandoned. When you have a negative emotion, it’s natural to
    want to experience less of what causes that emotion and to feel stressed and unhappy
    if you can’t do that.

3

Step 5. If the original interpretation was wrong, then your brain may have generated the wrong
emotions. If so, they also need to change. (Please remember this idea! It’s the key that
unlocks how TEAM therapy works.)

In other words, emotions are a powerful way the brain tries to match your actions with your
interpretations. Emotions are immediate, emotions are generated without any conscious
thinking, and emotions are powerful! _Emotions are powerful because their job is to motivate
you to carry out the actions your brain believes – correctly or incorrectly – will increase the
likelihood of survival._

```
The discovery that emotions come from our interpretations is one of
the most important discoveries about the brain that has ever been
made. In TEAM therapy, you’ll learn many ways to use this discovery
to change the way you feel.
```

Step 4. It’s possible the first interpretations and predictions you make are wrong, so your brain
also needs to do some quality control. In this step, your brain re-analyzes information in case
the interpretations and predictions need to change. If one interpretation is more correct than
another one, your brain usually will choose the one that’s more accurate. After all, you’re
more likely to survive if your predictions are based on correct interpretations than incorrect
ones.

Step 5. If the original interpretations and predictions are wrong, then your brain also may have
generated the wrong emotions. If so, your brain will automatically generate different
emotions to match your new interpretations and predictions.

_Steps 4 and 5 are the keys to understanding how TEAM therapy works. Working with your
therapist, or with Feeling Great, you’ll learn powerful techniques for carrying out the quality
control (Step 4) that’s needed to experience happier emotions. Once you carry out Step 4, your
brain will automatically change your emotions (Step 5) because that is how the brain works._

```
Emotions are the way your brain tries to match your actions with
your interpretations and predictions. Emotions are immediate,
emotions are generated without any conscious thinking, and
emotions are powerful! Emotions are powerful because their job is
to motivate you to carry out the actions your brain believes –
correctly or incorrectly – will increase the likelihood of survival.
```
```
The discovery that emotions come from our interpretations and
predictions is one of the most important discoveries about the brain
that has ever been made. In TEAM therapy, you’ll learn many ways
to use this discovery to change the way you feel.
```
### B. The cells where it happens

Everything that you think and feel is based on the activity of cells in your brain called nerve cells
(or neurons). Every memory you have, everything you imagine, every interpretation of your
experiences, every prediction you make and every emotion you feel all exist because of your
nerve cells.

_With TEAM therapy, you’re going to learn how to modify specific nerve cells in your own brain.
You’re going to learn how to conduct your own personal micro-neurosurgery, with a specificity
that no neurosurgeon in the world can match._

Understanding how nerve cells work will:

- Make it easier for you to change them in ways that will make you happier;
- Help you understand why some of the unique features of TEAM therapy help make this
    approach so powerful;
- Help you understand why TEAM therapy also is more effective than using medications.

Five ideas are critical in understanding how nerve cells work, and how TEAM therapy works.

#### 1. You have a lot of nerve cells but not a lot ways for them to talk to each other

It takes a lot of nerve cells to store and process all the experiences that help make you who you
are, so many that your brain contains around 100 billion of these cells. As a comparison, it’s
thought that about 107 billion humans have ever lived in the entire history of the world. So, you


have almost as many nerve cells in your brain as there are people that have ever lived on this
planet! And your brain is even more complex than that, because each nerve cell makes
connections with hundreds, or thousands, of other nerve cells. That means there are trillions of
interactions that occur between the nerve cells tucked away in each of our heads.

Nerve cells communicate with each other by releasing small amounts of specific chemicals.
These chemicals are called _neurotransmitters_. This communication mostly occurs between
specific nerve cells, but some of the chemicals released can affect larger numbers of cells.

There’s a problem with neurotransmitters that’s critical in understanding some of the differences
between TEAM therapy and the use of medications – and also helps explain why
antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs can cause so many different side effects.

The problem is this: Although there are around 100 billion nerve cells, there are only around
100 - 200 neurotransmitters. That means that there are millions and millions and millions of nerve
cells in your brain that all use the same neurotransmitters to communicate with each other. In
addition, there are other nerve cells in different parts of your body (such as in your gut and your
heart) that also use the same neurotransmitters.

Some neurotransmitters are affected by anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications, but a
drug that changes a neurotransmitter changes it all over the body. Every cell that uses that
neurotransmitter, anywhere in the body, is affected. It doesn’t matter what part of your brain that
cell is in, or even if it’s not in your brain at all.

One way to think about why this is a problem is to consider your computer:

- Everything you do on your computer uses electricity, which works like a
    neurotransmitter. The electricity allows each tiny wire to communicate with other tiny
    little wires in your computer.
- The specificity that occurs is because of how the parts of your computer are connected
    to each other.

TEAM therapy is like using your computer to do something specific.

In contrast, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs are like changing the electricity in all the
circuits in your whole computer at the same time. If you change the electricity in your whole
computer, you change it for all those tiny little wires, with no specificity.

The ability to work with specific nerve cells in your brain is critical both in understanding why
TEAM therapy is so powerful and why it’s very different than using medications.

#### 2. Brain function requires specificity

How does your brain solve the problem of working with 100 billion nerve cells in an organized
way? It’s hard enough to figure out what’s going on when you’re in a group of 10 people and
they’re all talking and acting at the same time. Yet your brain is able to work with a much more
complex challenge.

The brain doesn’t always work perfectly, to be sure. Still, considering how many nerve cells
there are, and everything the brain has to do, it generally does a pretty good job of doing what
it’s supposed to do.


One of the reasons your brain can do its jobs correctly is because nerve cell activation is very
specific. You can usually find the nerve cells you need whenever you need them.

Imagine how difficult your life would be if every time you needed to do something, you had to go
sorting through all your different nerve cells to find the ones you need. It’s hard enough to work
efficiently if you have to sort through 20 different things on your desk every time you start a new
task. If you had to sort through billions of nerve cells every time you needed to do something,
you’d never get anything done.

#### 3. Specificity is possible because nerve cells work in networks

How does specificity occur, and how can you use that specificity to transform your emotional
life?

One of the reasons that your brain is able to find the right cells when it needs them is because
nerve cells are organized into functional units called _networks_. Some networks represent a
single simple fact encoded in a small number of nerve cells that may even be located in just one
brain region. Larger networks connect multiple memories and thoughts together with each
other.

Understanding a little bit about nerve cell networks will help you understand how TEAM therapy
works. These networks are also critical in understanding how rapid change is even possible,
why particular techniques are used at particular times and in particular ways and how to make
them more powerful.

Three ideas about nerve cell networks are particularly important in understanding TEAM
therapy:

- Our memories, our interpretations, our predictions and our emotions all depend on the
    activity of specific nerve cell networks.
- It seems that each nerve cell network can be used whenever the information it
    represents is needed.
- Learning occurs by modifying nerve cell networks.

The reason the same nerve cell networks are used over and over is that even though the brain
has lots of cells and networks, there’s not enough of them to use a different one for every
moment and thought and feeling in your life. For example, you don’t create a new nerve cell
network every time you need to solve a math problem where you need to know that 2+2=4.
When you first learned that fact, you created a new network. Once that network was created, it’s
a much more efficient use of nerve cells to activate that same network whenever you need the
fact that 2+2=4.

Let’s consider an example of how nerve cell networks are critical in understanding where
emotions come from and why TEAM therapy is effective.

Let’s say someone did something awful to you in the past, and caused terrible memories and
emotions. All of your memories about that event are contained in nerve cell networks. Even
though the memories can cause powerful emotions, the memories are not the event. The
memories are groups of nerve cells.

The nerve cell networks that represent your memories of an awful event can be activated if
you’re reminded of the event – and this is how emotional triggers work. Those networks might


be activated (triggered) by a picture of the person who hurt you, or by a sound, or a smell or
even a word that reminds you of what happened.

When your memories of an awful event are activated, your brain unleashes powerful emotions
because it’s trying to protect you from being hurt again. This is because when your brain
remembers those memories, the emotions are generated as a way to protect you from harm.
When you’re reminded of the hurtful event, even unconsciously, your brain will generate
negative emotions as signals to warn you of the possibility of danger.

The problem is that those powerful emotions also can leave you under the control of whoever
hurt you. That person might even be long gone, but the way you remember them is letting them
continue to have power over you now.

How do you get out of this emotional trap?

The way you take control of your emotions is by learning to modify your nerve cell networks,
which is what you’re going to do in the steps of TEAM therapy. Even for memories of trauma
that can be so powerful that it feels like you’re having the experience again, those memories are
not the real event. Whatever happened is not still happening, no matter how powerful the
memories and the emotions are. The memories are networks of nerve cells so small that you
need a microscope to see them. By learning how to modify those nerve cell networks, you can
take control over the emotions associated with those memories.

The most effective way to get out of emotional traps associated with hurtful past events is to
learn how to take control of your interpretations, predictions and emotions so that you’re the one
in charge. You can’t change the past, but you can change the way remembering the past
affects you, so that your emotions are not being regulated by someone who hurt you. This is not
about forgetting, or forgiving or condoning what happened to you. This is about giving you the
power to be in charge of your own emotions instead of letting that power stay with someone
else.

In other words, you get out of this trap by careful modification of specific nerve cell networks. It’s
an exciting idea that we have the ability to choose how we’re going to feel, and learning how to
do this is one of the important skills you’ll learn in TEAM therapy.

The question thus is how do you modify specific nerve cell networks – and one answer is by
using principles that are central for effective learning and that are critical in TEAM therapy.

#### 4. You can modify your nerve cell networks - which is how learning occurs

We all have the ability to modify our nerve cell networks, and we do this every time we learn
something new. Our brains are not like a computer that comes with its programs already
installed. We start off without many skills at all – we can’t speak, or understand words, or do
very much beyond making a small number of sounds and doing other things needed to get an
adult to love us and take care of us. Oh yes, along with feeding, drinking, and getting rid of
what we ate and drank.

There’s a lot that you need to learn if you’re going to survive, and you do that by modifying your
nerve cell networks. If the connections between your nerve cells couldn’t be changed, you’d
never be able to learn. Sometimes when you’re learning – particularly when you’re young – you
have to build new networks for your new skills. Pretty soon, however, you’re doing most
learning by modifying the networks you’ve already built.


Activating and modifying nerve cell networks in specific ways obviously works pretty well, or you
wouldn’t be sitting here reading this guide to TEAM therapy. In fact, you wouldn’t be here at all
because you would not have been able to survive. It turns out that every type of life that has
nerve cells is able to learn, and they do this by modifying their nerve cells and nerve cell
networks. Being able to change their properties as part of learning is a fundamental part of how
nerve cells work.

TEAM therapy works by finding out what you need to learn, and using powerful strategies to
make the learning more effective. In this approach, you’ll use multiple learning techniques to
help you modify the specific nerve cell networks important in your personal emotional recovery.

#### 5. The rules of effective learning are all important in TEAM therapy

In TEAM therapy, you’re going to learn how to modify your nerve cell networks. You’ll learn how
to find the right networks and to modify them in ways that will cause powerful emotional change.

How do you do this most effectively?

Modifying nerve cell networks follows eight rules, which are all important in understanding
TEAM therapy:

1. To modify a specific nerve cell network, you first have to activate it. You know that
    you’ve activated a network because you’re aware of the information it carries, instead of
    just using that information without consciously thinking about it.
2. One way to modify nerve cell networks is to connect them to other networks by getting
    them to work together. Networks that work together become connected with each other,
    which scientists summarize with the saying “ _What Fires Together Wires Together.”_ This
    is the most important concept in understanding how all learning occurs. In addition, the
    more often that nerve cell networks work with each other, the stronger the connections
    become. This is one of the ways that new networks are formed and that existing
    networks become stronger.
3. What’s “ _Wired Together tends to Fire Together_ ” is also a critical concept in
    understanding all kinds of learning and behavior. This is why once you’ve learned
    something it gets easier to repeat it every time you do it. Habits are behaviors caused
    by the rule that when nerve cell networks are wired together, it’s easier to get them to
    fire together. This rule is also why we keep using certain patterns of thinking.
4. Learning effectively requires attention and slow analytical thinking if you’re trying to
    change your interpretations of the world. This is different from building what’s called
    muscle memory where too much thinking seems to interfere with building at least certain
    types of muscle memory. For example, when you’re learning to ride a bike, or to ski, or
    to play tennis, or to play a musical instrument, “overthinking” what you’re doing makes it
    more difficult to complete the task. This is not the case, however, for changing the way
    you interpret the world.
5. Learning is more effective when you use multiple types of brain function to learn
    something. Learning in this way brings more networks together to form still larger ones
    and also helps build stronger networks more quickly. When you learn in this way, you’re
    also paying more attention to whatever you’re learning – and that attention also makes
    learning more effective.
       For example, you can learn something new by reading about it but the learning is
    more effective if you also write notes about what you’re reading. When you write, you’re
    thinking about what you want to learn and about the words that you use. You’re also
    using your muscles to write the words, and you’re using your vision to check the words


```
as you write them. You’re using other brain networks to make sure the words are
correct. If you also discuss what you’re writing down, you’re bringing in even more
networks of nerve cells. By having multiple different networks work together, it’s easier
to learn something new.
You can try this yourself with some simple experiments. For example, let’s say you
want to learn the name of a new person you just met. If they just tell you their name, you
may have trouble remembering it. I know I do. It’s a lot easier to remember their name
if you use it several times while you’re talking together, and also write it down. You can
also ask them what the name means, and so forth. Using all these different approaches
will make it much easier to remember the new name.
```
6. Learning is also more effective if you discover answers for yourself than if someone just
    tells you the answers. TEAM therapy is built so that you’ll be the one who makes most
    of the discoveries that you need to make.
7. One of the most powerful enhancers of learning is surprise. In fact, surprise is the most
    effective way to cause a rapid change in your interpretations of the world. This makes a
    lot of sense from the perspective of brain function, because the fact that you’re surprised
    means that whatever happened was not something you predicted. That means you need
    to adjust your interpretations, because making the wrong prediction can decrease your
    likelihood of survival. Surprise also is a powerful enhancer of learning because it is the
    only emotion that forces you to evaluate your interpretations and predictions so quickly.
    Thus, it seems that surprise can even trigger the slow analytical thinking that is so
    important in learning. And surprise focuses your attention very effectively.
8. As powerful as surprise as an enhancer of learning is a strong emotional experience of
    any sort. If you think back over your life, you’ll find that your strongest memories are
    those that have a strong emotional quality to them. If the experience was a positive one,
    then you will have positive emotions that make you want to repeat the experience. Such
    emotions include desirability, curiosity and joy. If the experience was a negative one,
    then the emotions will be ones that make you not want to repeat that experience. Such
    emotions include anxiety, fear, guilt and shame.
       If you combine surprise with emotions (which is often the case), then you have an
    immensely powerful means of enhancing learning.

```
Everything that you learn occurs by generating new networks of
nerve cells and by modifying existing networks. When you change
your interpretations, you do it by modifying specific networks of
nerve cells. This is something you’ve been doing all of your life. Every
time you learn something new, you’re carrying out highly focused
micro-neurosurgery on your own brain in order to modify specific
nerve cell networks! No neurosurgeon, anywhere in the world, can
change your brain with the specificity you achieve every time you
learn something new.
```
```
TEAM therapy uses multiple powerful learning techniques to modify
specific nerve cell networks. For example, when you talk with your
therapist, and answer their questions, you’ll be activating specific
nerve cell networks. You’ll learn new ideas and new skills, which will
help you modify those nerve cell networks. When you discuss these
new ideas in different ways, you’ll fire the nerve cell networks
together and wire them together. You’ll also use writing in the
session and in your home practice to strengthen the new networks
even more. And you’ll discover for yourself many of the answers that
you need.
```

### C. Thinking fast, thinking slow, and the stories that shape our interpretations

One of the most intriguing analyses of thinking in recent times is research suggesting we use
two different types of thinking to understand the world. These are called _fast_ and _slow_ thinking,
and they appear to be critical in understanding TEAM therapy and how to make it more
powerful. Fast and slow thinking also seem to be critical in understanding how depression,
anxiety, relationship problems, habits and addictions occur.

_Fast thinking:_ Most thinking occurs so quickly that we’re not even aware of how or why we’ve
reached a conclusion. Fast thinking is intuitive, unconscious and automatic, and enables us to
solve problems so quickly that the answer seems to appear immediately. This approach to
interpreting the world and making predictions is based on what we’ve already learned and what
we already believe is true.

_Slow thinking:_ Slow thinking is what we do when we’re trying to learn something new, or trying
to solve a problem that requires us to break out of our standard habits of thought. Slow
thinking is a conscious and deliberate type of thinking that requires more focus and attention
than fast thinking.

Even though slow analytical approaches to problem solving are what most people believe
they’re doing when they’re thinking, it seems that we mostly use rapid thinking and only rarely
use slow thinking. The fact that we mostly use rapid thinking makes sense for several reasons:

- During evolution, the most important problems were ones that needed immediate
    responses. These problems were often how to keep from being eaten, and taking too
    much time to respond could be fatal. Thus, the ability to interpret, predict and respond
    rapidly would have helped keep us alive.
- Fast thinking also seems to be a natural consequence of how nerve cell networks
    function. We discussed earlier the idea that nerve cell networks that are “wired together
    fire together.” Fast thinking lets you respond quickly because it uses nerve cell networks
    that are already wired together.
- Fast thinking is also the most efficient way to get through the day. Most of our days are
    similar to each other, and events that require slow thinking to figure out a novel response
    are pretty rare. If we already know what to do, then it doesn’t make sense to spend a lot
    of time thinking about it.

_Fast thinking depends on our internal stories_ : One of the reasons fast thinking is so easy to use
is because we organize most of our thoughts in terms of stories that link together multiple
networks. Stories make it easier to remember and understand information. Stories also make it
easier to recognize patterns, which is critical for predicting what’s going to happen. The ability of
stories to help us make predictions also makes our day-to-day lives easier. If you “know how
the story goes,” making predictions and drawing conclusions is quick and doesn’t require a lot of
effort.

The tendency to use existing stories to understand the world is so powerful that we often
interpret things in the wrong way because it’s easier to fit them into an existing story than to
create a new one. Using fast thinking in this way can also be part of how your brain tries to
keep you safe. For example, let’s say a past event hurt you in some way. If something
traumatic happened to you, any similar event can trigger the feelings of that trauma even if the
similarity is small. If the trauma involved a gunshot or an explosion, for example, the first
interpretation of a sudden sound is of danger. If someone abused you, anything that reminds
you of that person can trigger your internal alarms. It might be a smell, an accent, a piece of
clothing, the color of someone’s skin, or anything else that wakes up the nerve cell networks
that were created by that trauma.


Fast thinking is useful, but it’s a strategy that runs into problems when

- our existing nerve cell networks lead to incorrect interpretations and predictions, or
- we’re in a situation where we need to figure out new solutions.

For example, people who are depressed often interpret the world through internal stories that
say life is hopeless and that they can’t be helped. People with anxiety have internal stories that
something bad is going to happen. These stories generate fast thinking responses that lead to
negative interpretations and predictions.

If your internal stories and your habits of thought generate negative interpretations and
predictions, they can also generate the negative emotions that made you decide to work with a
therapist. When you generate these interpretations and emotions over and over again, the
networks that represent them get stronger and stronger. It becomes harder to change the
stories and the habits of thought that they’re built on.

Anxiety, depression, relationship problems, unhealthy habits and addictions usually go on for a
long time before you go a therapist, which means that the patterns of thought that are part of
your unhappiness have had a long time to become strong habits. You may even feel as though
nothing will ever change because your life has been like this for so long. This becomes part of
your fast thinking.

The internal stories and fast thinking patterns that are at the center of depression and anxiety
become like a maze with no way out because every interpretation keeps you trapped. Your
brain then makes the internal story even worse, with the interpretation that you’re broken and
helpless. You become convinced that your situation is hopeless.

If depression or anxiety is disrupting your life, then it’s critical to break out of your personal
maze. That’s hard to do if you keep using the same fast thinking strategies that you’ve been
using all along. After all, it’s those thinking strategies that created the maze.

The way we break out of a maze caused by flawed fast thinking is to use slow analytical thinking
to figure out what’s wrong and to figure out new interpretations. This is how you change your
internal stories and change your patterns of fast thinking.

If we look at this in terms of how thinking works at the level of nerve cells, we use slow
analytical thinking to modify existing nerve cell networks and to create new ones.

**Depression and anxiety are**

**like being trapped in a dark**

**maze. The internal stories**

**we tell ourselves keep us**

**trapped in this maze.**

**Eventually we can feel like**

**there’s no way out.**


TEAM therapy uses multiple strategies to help you break out of your own personal maze by
using slow analytical thinking:

- You’ll identify and become aware of your internal stories. Our stories are the way we
    interpret our own lives, and learning how those stories create our personal maze is
    important in curing depression and anxiety.
- By identifying the relevant internal stories, you’ll be activating the networks of nerve cells
    that you’re going to modify.
- You’ll find out that you’re not broken. One of the important discoveries in TEAM therapy
    is that depression and anxiety reveal what’s right about the way your brain is working!
    (We’ll look at this idea more closely in the next section of this guide, and again when
    we’re examining the steps in a TEAM therapy session.)
- You’ll identify thinking errors that keep you trapped in the maze, and learn how to
    overcome these errors. We all make lots of errors in our thinking, but we do this a lot
    more when we’re depressed or anxious. Those errors are critical in understanding and
    treating depression and anxiety.
- Although we’re often not aware of errors in our thinking, becoming aware of them is not
    enough by itself. People with depression or anxiety often realize that they’re thinking
    about things in a way that’s not helping them.
- You also need to change the errors in your thinking. In fact, if you know that you need
    change, but don’t create change, this could even strengthen the feelings that you’re
    broken. You can feel as though you’ll always be trapped in the maze.
- With TEAM therapy, you’ll learn powerful ways to identify errors in your thinking and also
    ways to fix them.

With TEAM therapy, you’re going to learn to use the power of slow analytical thinking to create
new habits of thought. These new ways of interpreting the world will set you on the path to
greater happiness. As you’ll see in Part II of this guide, TEAM therapy uses multiple ways to
encourage the use of slow thinking to analyze problems in a conscious, deliberate and focused
manner.

```
What’s the way out if you’re trapped in a maze of habits of thought,
internal stories and fast thinking that causes negative interpretations and
negative emotions?
```
```
The answer is to do what you’re going to learn to do in TEAM therapy,
which is to use your slow analytical thinking as the key for unlocking the
door to happiness. With TEAM therapy, you’ll learn to identify the fast
thinking patterns that are causing your emotional challenges. And you’ll
learn powerful techniques to change your habits of thought and to
generate new patterns of thinking.
```
```
As you master these skills, you’ll build new patterns of fast thinking, ones
that are associated with greater happiness. You’ll also learn powerful
ways to use your analytical thinking abilities to respond to any new
situation so that your recovery continues.
```
### D. Is your brain broken? Or is it just doing its job?

Let’s wrap us this introduction to brain function by comparing some of the ideas of TEAM
therapy with other ways of thinking about depression, anxiety and other emotional challenges.


The most fundamental disagreement in the field of treating depression, anxiety and related
problems is whether or not something is wrong in the brains of people who seek help in dealing
with their emotions.

- Therapists who use cognitive and behavioral therapy techniques, including TEAM
    therapy, believe that you’re not broken or defective. They believe instead that your
    thoughts include some thinking errors. They believe the most effective treatment for
    depression and anxiety is to correct the errors in your thinking strategies. TEAM
    therapists even believe that depression and anxiety are showing what’s right about you,
    and not what’s wrong about you.
- In contrast, many researchers and doctors believe that depression and anxiety are
    caused by the brain working incorrectly. They believe that something is defective in the
    brains of people with these problems.

Some of the most dramatic claims that brains work differently in people with depression and
anxiety than in other people are focused on specific parts of the brain called the _amygdala_ and
the _prefrontal cortex_ :

- The _amygdala_ is a part of the brain that’s important in creating your emotions. Overall,
    this part of the brain is called the _limbic system_. The limbic system, including the
    amygdala, are involved in creating both positive and negative emotions.
- The amygdala, and the rest of the limbic system, have many functions, but they’re
    particularly important in setting off alarms if they sense danger. These alarms are called
    the “fight or flight” response (or, sometimes, the” flight, fight or freeze” response).
- The responses of your amygdala, and your limbic system are immediate, and rely on
    unconscious fast thinking.
- The _prefrontal cortex_ has different jobs than the amygdala and the rest of the limbic
    system. The prefrontal cortex, which sits right behind your forehead, is more developed
    in humans than in any other animal. As indicated by its name, it’s part of the cortex.
- The prefrontal cortex, and the cortex in general, are responsible for many of the qualities
    that are especially human. These include, for example, planning, judgement, self-
    awareness, and language.
- The prefrontal cortex also can turn off the alarm systems in the amygdala by sending
    information that everything is okay.
- The slow analytical thinking you use to examine the accuracy of your interpretations and
    to solve new problems depends on the cortex, and perhaps particularly on the prefrontal
    cortex.

If you’ve been learning about depression and anxiety, you may have read that the amygdala
and prefrontal cortex work differently if you’re depressed or anxious than when you’re feeling
good.

- Studies in people with anxiety or depression suggest the amygdala is more activated by
    information it thinks indicates danger. If you’re anxious or depressed, your amygdala
    may even treat neutral information as though it means you’re in danger.
- Similar imaging studies suggest the prefrontal cortex also seems to be less active in
    people with depression or anxiety.
- In addition, interactions between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala seem to be less
    effective in people with depression or anxiety.
- If the prefrontal cortex is less active, and is not communicating effectively with the
    amygdala, this could mean that it’s harder to do the quality control of interpretations and
    predictions that can change your emotions easily and quickly.

The problem is that even if these differences exist, that doesn’t mean your brain is broken or
defective. This is because changes like these are all part of normal brain function.


During most of evolution, being able to super-activate the amygdala and suppress the prefrontal
cortex for a few minutes probably helped keep you alive. That’s because if you didn’t respond
quickly enough to potential danger, you were more likely to get killed and eaten. If your brain
interpreted something as a sign of danger, the amygdala and the limbic system took control.
Activity in the prefrontal cortex was suppressed, and the brain was flooded with emotions that
helped you survive by activating your fight-or-flight response. That way, you reacted quickly
without spending extra time doing slow analytical thinking. Then, when the danger was over,
these responses turned off and a more balanced relationship between the prefrontal cortex and
the limbic system returned.

The problem we have in our modern world is that the stresses that trigger your limbic danger
response can continue for a long time. Even worse, it seems that the limbic system does not do
a good job of telling the difference between events that are real and thoughts about events that
are just your nerve cell networks firing. Activation of your memories about something that
happened in the past can trigger your limbic system. So can worrying about things that might
happen in the future, but also might not, and that certainly are not happening now.

Our human brains are great at worrying about the past and the future instead of focusing on
what’s going on right now. This means that instead of the limbic alarms turning off in a few
minutes when the danger’s over, the alarms stay on, activity in the prefrontal cortex is
suppressed and communication between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala is less
effective. Even if there’s no danger right at this moment, the limbic system can keep firing if
you’re worrying about the possibility of something that will cause you pain.

All of these changes cause the emotions associated with anxiety. If the stressful situation keeps
going on without getting better, you also might start feeling helpless and hopeless – which are
two of the most frequent emotions in depression.

Although it sounds pretty serious if important parts of your brain are working differently when
you’re depressed or anxious, it could easily be that these changes occur because of the stress
associated with depression and anxiety. Instead of indicating that there’s something wrong with
your brain, these changes might show that your brain is responding to your stressful thoughts
just as it’s supposed to respond.

Which view is true? We’ll return to this question after we go through the steps of a TEAM
therapy session. Then it will be easy to see how TEAM therapy can help determine whether
changes in brain function are caused by the stress of depression and anxiety. If this view is
correct, then these changes are not a sign that your brain is broken. Instead, they’re a sign that
your brain is just doing its job.

More importantly, if changes like we’ve talked about in this section are occurring because of
your thoughts, then how do we help your brain work in a more peaceful and happier way?
Learning how to do this is a part what you’ll experience in TEAM therapy.

## Part II: The 10 steps of TEAM therapy

TEAM stands for Testing, Empathy, Addressing resistance and Methods. These are some of
the necessary components of TEAM therapy. This approach also includes learning powerful
skills that will help you lead a happier life, as well as training that will enable you to react calmly
and effectively if you ever have a relapse.


One of the most important features of TEAM therapy is that every component has been thought
out in great detail. This is true from the moment you start interacting with your therapist (or start
working with the exercises in _Feeling Great_ ) to the time you’ve recovered completely, to the
training you’ll receive in relapse prevention.

Another important feature of TEAM therapy is the ability to change the order in which certain
steps occur, and to revisit particular steps in any way needed for each individual. This can be
confusing when you listen to live sessions, because the details of the session can vary with
different people. The use of thoughtful improvisation, however, is also one of the reasons TEAM
therapy is so powerful. We each have individual needs, and our needs may even differ from
one session to the next. By understanding the goals of each step of TEAM therapy, it becomes
possible to interweave them in multiple ways to align with the needs of each person.

Let’s look at how TEAM therapy works, what aspects of this approach are unique, and how you
can work together most effectively with your therapist and/or with _Feeling Great_ to achieve the
joy that you seek.

## Step 1: Committing to an action plan

The reason you’re talking with a therapist, or thinking of talking with a therapist, is because your
emotional life is not going the way you want.

When your emotional life is not going well, there are always internal stories that are important in
understanding those emotions. Is it that you’re broken, that your brain is defective, that you’re
helpless and it’s all hopeless? Is it believing that something awful is going to happen to you?

What if your internal story said you’re not broken?

What if you could be happy?

What would that be worth to you?

Most people with depression or anxiety spend a lot of time every day thinking about their
depression, or their anxiety. You’ve probably experienced this also. It’s easy to spend a lot of
time every day worrying about what’s wrong. Many people often spend years in therapy, years
being treated with powerful medications, or both. Sometimes they make slow progress, and
sometimes they don’t make any progress at all. They can spend a lot of money, and the drugs
they use can have unpleasant side effects.

What if you could take 15 minutes a day out of your worrying time, a few days each week for a
couple of months (and maybe less), to achieve a happier state of mind?

Here’s another way of thinking about these questions. What would you say to a friend who told
you they wanted to learn how to play the guitar, but wasn’t willing to practice between lessons
and only wanted to play guitar when they met with their teacher once a week? Would you tell
them that was a great idea? Do you think they’d be able to learn to play the guitar this way?
Of course not!

Learning new ways of thinking is faster than learning how to be skilled musician, but it still takes
some practice. Your therapist might call the practice “homework,” but perhaps you didn’t enjoy
doing homework when you were in school. Practicing TEAM therapy techniques is going to be


a lot more fun, however, than the kind of homework you had to do in school. Best of all, you’ll
learn skills that really will be useful the rest of your life.

Working together both in sessions and by completing exercises on your own between sessions,
you and your therapist will be able to make rapid progress.

Your therapist also may ask you to buy and start working with the book _Feeling Great_ , which
contains lots of information on TEAM therapy and helpful ways of practicing this new way of
thinking. _Feeling Great_ costs about $ 20. It’s like getting a second therapist for much less than
the normal cost of therapy appointments – and this is one you can work with whenever you
want, any time of day or night.

## Step 2: Finding out how you’re doing ( Testing )

One of the unique aspects of TEAM therapy is that every therapy session starts and ends with
filling out a simple Brief Mood Survey on your emotional state.^ The Brief Mood Survey is like an
emotional thermometer. It provides information needed to start a session quickly and without
stress.

The Brief Mood Survey provides information on Depression, Suicidal thoughts, Anxiety, Anger,
Relationship Satisfaction, and Positive Feelings. It’s simple to score for each category, and only
takes a minute or so to complete. The information in the Brief Mood Survey makes it easy to
see where to focus, and where a change in approach may be needed. If it’s hard for you to
describe your emotions, the Brief Mood Survey also makes it easy to do this by including a list
of emotions and a place to score how strongly you’re feeling them.

The Brief Mood Survey also tells you and your therapist what kind of progress you’re making.
For your therapist, this lets them keep track of how well they’re doing when they’re working with
you. Filling out the Brief Mood Survey can also reveal problems that need attention but aren’t
being talked about. Using this “emotional thermometer” makes it easy for the two of you to find
out if details of your treatment strategy need to be changed.

The Brief Mood Survey can be found in multiple versions by searching for “David Burns Brief
Mood Survey” on the web 3 (The most recent versions include a section on positive feelings,
which was not included in earlier versions of this form.) There is a more detailed version in
Chapter 1 of _Feeling Great_ , with an explanation of how to interpret the scores in each section.
There are also versions of this form in Dr. Burns’ earlier books.

Here’s an example of what a section of the Brief Mood Survey looks like, from a version that lets
you put your Before and After session scores next to each other. As you can see, all you need
to do to fill out this form is to read the questions and put a check in the boxes that indicate how
you’re feeling.

TF-8&oe=UTF- 8


There are two additional aspects of the Brief Mood Survey that may be particularly interesting:

- First, I mentioned above that this emotional thermometer measures both negative and
    positive emotions. The measurement of positive feelings tells you a lot about the goals
    of TEAM therapy, which are to decrease unhappiness **and** to increase happiness.
    These are not two sides of a see-saw, where one must go up if the other goes down.
    Indeed, one of the most common side effects of multiple antidepressants is a
    phenomenon called emotional blunting^4 , where all your emotions are at a lower volume.
    The specific goals of TEAM therapy are to enable you to turn down the volume on your
    emotional demons as low as you would like, and also to enable your emotional angels to
    sing with joy.
- A second feature of the Brief Mood Survey that seems intriguing concerns the
    observations, discussed in Section 1, that the interactions between your prefrontal cortex
    and your amygdala/limbic system may be decreased in depression and anxiety. If
    decreased interactions between your prefrontal cortex and your limbic system are
    important in understanding depression and anxiety, then we need ways to increase the
    interaction between these parts of your brain. Identifying your emotions is taking the
    information of your limbic system and converting it to words (which occurs in your
    cortex). Deciding how strongly you feel each emotion also requires skills that involve
    your prefrontal cortex and cortex. (In addition, as you’ll see, TEAM therapy has multiple
    other steps that seem like they require your prefrontal cortex and your limbic system to
    work together.)

```
TEAM therapy is the only type of psychotherapy where you score
your feelings at the beginning and end of every session. This tells you
a lot about the goals of TEAM therapy. If recovery was going to take
years, then why would you check your emotional state at the
beginning and end of every session? It only makes sense to check
so often if you’re using a therapy in which rapid progress is the goal.
```
(^4) This is an important concern for many people who take antidepressants, as one of the side
effects that troubles many users is an emotional blunting so that they feel neither up or down.
As just one example, recent studies from Oxford University reported emotional blunting in about
half of people treated with multiple categories of antidepressants,

**_Step 3 : Being accepted, telling your story and activating the nerve cell networks you’re
going to modify (Empathy)_**

The next step in TEAM therapy is Empathy. This step will accomplish four goals.

1. _Acceptance by your therapist:_ The empathy step in TEAM therapy lets you feel seen,
    understood and accepted for who you are. When empathy is going well, you’ll feel
    connected with each other.
2. _Alignment with your therapist_ : You’ll learn that you’re working with someone who can be
    counted on to be on your side, and who’s going to help you if things get rough.
3. _Decreasing stress_ : If you’re feeling accepted and understood, then your stress levels will
    decrease naturally. Decreasing stress is a big help any time you’re trying to learn new
    ways of thinking. The activation of your limbic system will decrease, your flight-or-fight
    response will turn off, and activation of your prefrontal cortex will increase naturally as a
    part of normal brain function. It will be easier to do the slow thinking that your brain uses
    to solve problems and to learn new skills.
4. _Activation of nerve cell networks:_ The fourth critical goal you’ll accomplish during the
    empathy step is to activate nerve cell networks that you’re going to learn how to modify.
    Activating these networks happens when you’re telling your story during the Empathy
    step. The combination of activating and modifying these networks is critical in
    understanding why TEAM therapy is so effective and also in understanding how it differs
    from other therapies.

By learning that you’re in a safe space where you don’t have to defend yourself and where you
can say anything you need to say, you’ll be able to share what’s troubling you. This means
you’ll be able to activate nerve cell networks that need to be modified. Feeling safe also allows
you to even share information that you haven’t shared with other people. Many people have
secrets that they’re afraid to share – sometimes even with themselves. The secrets could be
about something that they did, thought or said, but just as often they’re about something that
was done or said to them. For example, many people who were physically or sexually abused
feel intense shame about what happened. They can be reluctant to share such information with
anyone for fear of being judged, or pitied. People might also have emotions that they’ve been
taught they’re not supposed to feel, or express – and so they even hide them from themselves.

All your troubling feelings and thoughts are the way you experience activation of the nerve cell
networks you need to modify. The way that you know you’ve activated these nerve cell
networks is to talk about your negative feelings and negative thoughts, and to write about them.
In other words, it’s by telling your story.

During the empathy step, your therapist will check frequently to see if they’re understanding you
correctly. If there’s something you think they need to know that hasn’t come up yet, then you’re
in a safe place where you can share information about anything that’s troubling you. If they’re
not understanding what you’ve told them, then it’s important to correct them.

Before completing the Empathy step, your therapist may ask you to grade them on how well
they’re understanding you. If you think they’re understanding you well, but something is still
missing, then give them a B, or even a B plus. If you think they’re not doing a good job, then
give them a lower grade. Your therapist’s goal is to understand you so well that you decide that
the right grade is an A. Only give this perfect grade if you feel they’ve shown full acceptance
and full understanding of you.


_Empathy when you’re working by yourself: The value of understanding brain function._

What if you’re working with _Feeling Great_ , or another book, instead of working with a therapist?
Clinical studies found that doing the exercises in Dr Burns’ first book, _Feeling Good_ , works as
well as working with a therapist for about half the people who do this^5. In these studies, half of
the people with clinical levels of depression were cured by doing the exercises in _Feeling Good_
for 20 minutes or so every day for a month. Moreover, three years later they were still cured –
and if they had a down day, they just did the exercises in _Feeling Good_ again. That’s pretty
remarkable, considering that the only thing these people did was spend some time during one
month doing the exercises in an inexpensive book, with no drugs and no therapists. _Feeling
Great_ benefits from 40 years of further research from Dr. Burns since he wrote _Feeling Good_ ,
and is likely to be even more effective.

Using a book can work like empathy from a therapist for several reasons:

- Empathy is about how you feel about the interaction. Many of us have read a book or a
    poem, or heard a song, or seen a play or a movie, and felt the words ring so true that we
    felt understood and connected to the author of those words. The writing in _Feeling Great_
    does that in multiple ways.
- For example, the books by Dr. Burns are very good at helping you feel that you’re cared
    about. Dr. Burns does a great job of connecting with others with his writing. He receives
    many letters and emails every week from people telling him how much empathy they feel
    when they work with his books.
- Reading also can have a tremendous intimacy. You can imagine the people Dr. Burns
    writes about. You’re learning of their burdens and their breakthroughs, and may even
    find pictures of them developing in your brain. (This experience is even stronger when
    you hear people in the live sessions available in the podcasts at [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com) .)
- _Feeling Great_ , and other books by Dr. Burns, also contain many examples of people
    solving a wide range of emotional problems. When you read these books, you’ll find that
    other people with experiences like yours can solve their emotional challenges with
    TEAM therapy. The books do a good job of communicating that even though you might
    be in misery right now, you’re not alone, you’re not broken and your emotional situation
    is not hopeless.
- Books also make it easy to go back and forth to different topics whenever you need to
    do so. That can be more difficult if you’re working with a therapist. Perhaps you don’t
    want to admit confusion (an admission that your therapist will consider as their own
    failure, not yours, so please let them know if that’s an issue). Perhaps you want to focus
    your paid time with your therapist on moving forward. Whatever the reason might be,
    with a book (and with the feellinggood.com podcasts) you can re-visit a particular topic
    as often as you like.

Understanding empathy from the perspective of brain function can show you how to make this
step even more powerful when you’re working by yourself. If we consider empathy from the
perspective of brain function, four topics seem important in carrying out this part of the TEAM
therapy journey without a therapist. These are:

_1. The power of writing_
    - The most obvious difference between working with a book and working with a therapist
       is that when you work with a therapist, what you’d be doing in an empathy session is
       telling your story. Telling your story is a key step in activating the networks of nerve cells
       that you’re going to modify.

(^5) These studies, led by Dr. Forrest Scogin, are summarized in _Feeling Great_ , pgs. 465-466.


- To tell your story if you’re working alone, from the perspective of brain function, the most
    effective way to activate the nerve cell networks you need to modify is to write down
    what you’d say to Dr. Burns if you were working with him. You can also do this by
    writing a letter to someone in your life, or to your future, present or past self. Whether
    you’re talking about your concerns with someone else, or writing them down for yourself,
    this is how you can be certain you’ve activated the networks of nerve cells that are
    important in understanding your emotions.
- Writing will help you express the story that defines your challenges.
- Another helpful thing about writing is that once you’ve written something down, you don’t
    have to spend effort trying to keep it in your active memory. If you’ve written something
    down, you can move on to the next thought without having to constantly remember what
    you’ve already written.
- You can set your thoughts down on paper, or type them into your computer, whichever
    you prefer. (If you’re using a computer, make sure that you save frequently and also
    that you’re using a writing program that automatically saves text every few minutes – a
    stress-inducing mistake I’ve made more than once.)
- If you’re not sure what to write, start with the reasons you checked the different boxes on
    the Brief Mood Survey. This is where a therapist would start, and it’s also where you
    can start when you’re working by yourself.
- You can also get some ideas about what to write about by listening to the empathy
    section of one or more live therapy sessions in the FeelingGood podcasts
    (www.feelinggood.com ). Listen to how someone explains what’s troubling them, and to
    the questions that help them expand on their story. Then imagine you’re the person in
    the session, and start telling your story.
- As you continue with writing, you’ll trigger memories of related information that you might
    want to add.
- One of the critical aspects of empathy in a TEAM therapy session is that it’s important to
    take as much time as needed to tell your story, because telling the story is the way that
    nerve cell networks are activated. So, take whatever time that you need to do this. That
    way, whenever you’re going to work on modifying your nerve cell networks all you have
    to do to get them activated is have a quick re-read of what you’ve written. By writing this
    information down, it’s also easy to go back and make additions or other changes
    whenever you remember other relevant information.
- Writing is so powerful that you can also do this between sessions and write down
    information you want to share with your therapist.

How much is the right amount to write? To some extent, the answer is to trust yourself. A half-
hour of empathy in a therapy session is equivalent to three to five pages of text. You can pace
yourself that way, if you like. Remember that the goal is not to describe every moment and
thought that comes to your mind, but to write down the ones that would let someone else
understand what’s troubling you. Writing can be, however, a powerful method of self-discovery
that helps us find out what we’re thinking – so write whatever you feel is needed.

_2. Giving yourself a grade_
    - Remember that before completing the Empathy step, your therapist will ask you to grade
       them on how well they’re understanding you. You can do the same thing for what you’ve
       written. This is not, however, like a teacher giving you a grade for a school essay you’ve
       written. No one is going to check on your grammar or spelling. The critical question is
       whether anything critical is missing from the story you need to tell.


_3. Changing how painful information affects you_
    - Something else important that often occurs during an empathy session is sharing painful
       information, and finding out that it’s okay to do this. This is part of changing the effects
       of that information on you. If you’ve had awful events in your life (as many people have),
       thinking about what happened can generate emotions to try and protect you from ever
       having similar events happen again. Those emotions provide clues about what’s
       important to you, and they reveal critical parts of the story you need to tell. The fact that
       remembering those past events is painful is an important reason to bring them into the
       light.
    - If you find that recalling and writing about certain information is very painful, a way to
       decrease that pain is to focus on curiosity and awareness. If you’re curious about what’s
       troubling you, and have the goal of becoming aware of this information, then it’s easier to
       step back and not get as involved in the emotions of what you’re writing.
    - If you do feel emotionally overwhelmed, and start crying (for example), that’s fine. In an
       empathy session with a therapist, you’d be encouraged to just let your feelings flow until
       you were ready to go on. You can do exactly the same thing if you’re writing by yourself.
    - _Even though memories can bring out overwhelming emotions, it’s critical to remember_
       _that the memories are not the event. Writing provides a powerful demonstration,_
       _occurring right there in front of you, that everything you remember and write down is not_
       _the event, but is words about the event that you’re putting down on a page_.

_4. Creating a safe space_

- Maybe you’re feeling too stressed to write. I get that. I’ve been pretty stressed writing
    this guide, as I try to figure out how to make it useful for others, what to include and what
    I can leave out. But it’s important to tell your story, so write down whatever comes to
    mind. Once you start, you’ll likely find that more thoughts will start to flow. And if you
    find that you still have more to say, keep going until you feel like you’ve put down the
    information that you’d like to share with a perfect friend (or a perfect therapist). If you
    have even more to say, then you can do this over several days.
- If you’d like to spend some time decreasing your feelings of stress before activating the
    networks of nerve cells to modify, there are many techniques that people use to do this.
    Controlled breathing, meditation and other mindfulness practices will help to turn down
    your fight or flight response. But it’s difficult to write while you’re focused on breathing or
    while you’re meditating, so maybe some peaceful background music is right for you. Or,
    if you’re a fan of aromatherapy, you can use that. Whichever approach you take to
    feeling safer, the goal is to turn down your fight or flight response and decrease your
    stress levels.
- Working with a book takes time, and you’re hopefully using _Feeling Great_ in a place
    where you feel safe while you’re doing this. You’re focusing your attention on this
    particular task in a physical space where you’re not under immediate threat. There’s no
    one there to attack you, and this will help give you a sense of being in a safe place.
    Over time, your fight-or-flight response will automatically turn off.

## Step 4: Work on a moment with the Daily Mood Log (DML)

Empathy doesn’t end after you’ve told your story and you think your therapist really understands
you. The next step is to find out if you’re ready to move on to the next step or whether you want
to spend more time talking about what’s troubling you. This is called the invitation to work, and
your therapist won’t move forward until you say that you’re ready. (If you’re working by yourself,
you can ask if everything you want to say is in the letter that you wrote in the previous section.)

If you’re ready to move on to the next step, then it’s time to look at your emotions in more detail.


```
One of the unique ways that TEAM therapy teaches you how to take a deeper look at your
emotions is to focus on just one moment. It could be a time in the past, or it could be right now.
It could also be some future event that you’re worried about. Just choose a moment when you
felt the emotions you scored in the Brief Mood Survey or you talked about during the Empathy
step.
```
```
The tool you’ll use to work on a single moment is called the Daily Mood Log (DML)^6. (In Feeling
Great, it’s called the Daily Mood Journal, but both names refer to the same forms.) To use the
DML, start by choosing a single moment to work on. Then go to the table at the beginning of
the DML and circle the words that describe your emotions. Then put in a number between 0
and 100 to describe how intensely you feel each emotion.
```
```
This is what the top table in the DML looks like. The DML looks simple, but it’s a remarkably
powerful tool.
```
```
If you’re working without a therapist, you’ll still use the DML just as described in the rest of this
guide. If you need more information, Feeling Great contains detailed instructions to using the
DML in Chapter 10, and in comments in multiple other chapters.

Before completing the Empathy step, your therapist may ask you to grade them on how well
they’re understanding you. If you think they’re understanding you well, but something is still
missing, then give them a B, or even a B plus. If you think they’re not doing a good job, then
give them a lower grade. Your therapist’s goal is to understand you so well that you decide that
the right grade is an A. Only give this perfect grade if you feel they’ve shown full acceptance
and understanding of you.
**_Step 4 : Work on a moment with the Daily Mood Journal_**
Empathy doesn’t end after you’ve told your story and you think your therapist really understands
you. The next step is to look at your emotions in more detail.
One of the unique ways that TEAM therapy teaches you how to take a deeper look at your
emotions is to focus on just one moment in time. It could be a time in the past, or it could be
right now. It could also be some future event that you’re worried about. Just choose a moment
when you felt the emotions you scored in the Brief Mood Survey or you talked about during the
Empathy step.
The discovery that you can solve all of your problems by focusing on one moment in time is a
surprising one. After all, it took time for you to decide that you needed to work with a therapist.
You might have had depression, anxiety or other emotional challenges for years. It seems hard
to believe that working on one moment can make an entire mountain of pain decrease, and
even disappear. It turns out though, that this approach is one of the reasons TEAM therapy is
so effective.
How can working on a single moment solve a problem that includes so many different times in
your life? The reason this approach works is because this is how your brain works.
Even though we have lots of nerve cells, we still don’t have enough to build a new network for
every event and moment in our lives. Instead, once you’ve built a network, your brain uses that
same network in many different situations. This approach is very efficient, but it’s a problem if
you’re using nerve cell networks that store information that’s wrong. For example, let’s say that
you were wrongly taught that 6 x 7 = 40. This means that every time you multiplied 6 x 7, in any
problem you tried to solve, you’d get the wrong answer. You’d get all those wrong answers
because your nerve cell networks for this information stored the wrong answer and kept using it.

The discovery that you can solve all of your problems by focusing on one moment in time is a
surprising one. After all, it took time for you to decide that you needed to work with a therapist.
You might have had depression, anxiety or other emotional challenges for years. It seems hard
to believe that working on one moment can make an entire mountain of pain decrease, and
even disappear. It turns out, though, that this approach is one of the reasons TEAM therapy is
so effective.

How can working on a single moment solve a problem that includes so many different times in
your life? The reason this approach works is because of the way your brain uses nerve cell
networks.

As we talked about in Part I, even though we have lots of nerve cells, we still don’t have enough
to build a new network for every event and moment in our lives. Instead, once you’ve built a
network, your brain uses that same network in many different situations. This approach is very
efficient, but it’s a problem if you’re using nerve cell networks that store information that’s wrong.
For example, let’s say that you were wrongly taught that 2+2 = 5. This means that every time
you added 2 + 2, in any problem you tried to solve, you’d get the wrong answer. You’d get all
those wrong answers because your nerve cell networks for this information stored the wrong
answer and kept using it. Once you fix it so that your brain now knows that 2 + 2 = 4, you’ve
modified the network of nerve cells that encoded the wrong answer to this problem. By doing
this, you’ve fixed this mistake for every time you solve a problem that needs you to add 2 + 2.
You can remember that you used to think that 2 + 2 = 5 , but now you can get the right answer
whenever you need it because you modified that network of nerve cells

Interpretations, predictions and other patterns of thinking work in the same way as information
about mathematics. If you learn a thinking pattern that is not helpful or is wrong, then any time
you use that pattern of thinking you’re likely to get an answer that’s not helpful or is incorrect.

The power of working on a single moment to modify nerve cell networks that you also use in
many other moments is another reason that TEAM therapy is so effective.

## Step 5: What are your negative thoughts?

Empathy is a necessary part of TEAM therapy, and feeling empathy from a friend or a therapist
can help you feel a bit better for a little while. It’s good to share your troubles with someone
who will accept you for who you are.

The problem is that if empathy was enough to make a difference, however, then most
psychotherapy would be quick and effective. That’s obviously not the case, even though most
therapists are pretty good at delivering empathy and letting you feel accepted and understood.

If you look at this puzzle from the point of view of how nerve cell networks work, it’s easy to
understand that empathy isn’t enough to create the change that you want and need because it
doesn’t change nerve cell function. Empathy can help you activate critical nerve cell networks
that need to be modified, but it doesn’t modify them. In fact, if you keep activating those
networks without changing them, they may just get stronger.

Remember that the central idea that explains how TEAM therapy works is that your emotions
come from your interpretations and predictions about what’s happening in your life. We may
talk as though our emotions are explained by the events of our lives, but what really causes our
emotions are the way we interpret those events. If your thoughts are negative, then your


emotions will be negative. If your interpretations and predictions change, then your emotions
will automatically change to match your updated interpretations and predictions.

Therefore, the next step in the TEAM therapy journey is to identify the negative thoughts that
help explain your emotions. These negative thoughts are the interpretations and predictions of
what’s going on in your life.

The first thing that you’ll do is choose a feeling you want to work on and write down the negative
thoughts associated with that feeling and how much you believe those thoughts are true. By
doing this, you’ll continue activating the specific nerve cell networks you’re soon going to
modify.

If you have difficulty coming up with negative beliefs associated with your feelings, you can start
by changing a feeling into a statement. For example, if you feel inferior, your negative thought
might be “I am inferior.” A negative thought could also be why you think you have a particular
feeling. For example, if you feel angry at your boss, a negative thought might be “My boss is
always unfair to me.”

If you’re having trouble identifying your negative thoughts, your therapist will help you learn how
to do this. In addition, _Feeling Great_ has lots of tips on how to identify your negative thoughts.
There are several rules for doing this discussed in Feeling Great on pages 176-181.

To do this effectively, it’s important to be specific about the type of negative thoughts that are
useful in the DML.

- A negative thought, for purposes of the DML, does not state your emotions. This is
    because your emotions are what you feel, and it’s absolutely true that you feel those
    emotions. Your emotions are not, however, the beliefs that are the cause of your
    feelings.
- Rhetorical questions are not useful, although it’s not hard to change them into something
    that is. For example, “Why is my boss/partner/relative always so mean to me?” is not a
    useful negative thought for the DML. It’s a rhetorical question that has no answer. In
    contrast “My boss/partner/relative is always mean to me” could be a useful negative
    thought to explore.
- Statements of fact are not useful, but sometimes can be used to find out the beliefs that
    are causing you to be anxious or depressed. For example, “I’ve been diagnosed with
    terminal cancer” is, unfortunately, a statement of fact for some people. That diagnosis
    may lead to negative emotions, but it’s not useful to work on it as a negative thought
    because that diagnosis is considered a true fact. It is useful, in contrast to examine
    your deeper worries, such as “I’m going to die and leave my family alone,” or “I’m going
    to die in great pain.” The deeper worries are the ones that are causing your emotions.
    (For an example of how this works, you can listen to podcasts with a woman who was
    diagnosed with advanced (Stage IV) lung cancer despite no previous indications of any
    cancer.)^7
- It’s clear, however, that people can have very different views about what is a fact, and
    whatever you consider a fact may turn out to be useful in understanding your emotions.
    People with certain religious beliefs, for example, might be upset because they believe

```
it’s a fact that someone they care about is going to face eternal punishment because of
their sexual preferences.
```
- Thus, the most important question to ask is whether the negative thought helps you
    understand the emotions you circled at the top of the DML. Even if it turns out it’s not a
    useful negative thought to work on the way it’s stated, it can still be a clue to something
    that will be useful to work on.

Learning to identify your negative thoughts starts the process of modifying the way you think in
several ways:

- In the Empathy part of TEAM therapy, you’re telling your story, but you’re not necessarily
    analyzing it. Using the DML to identify negative thoughts and define how much you
    believe them is different. Now you’re moving from the story-telling state of mind of the
    Empathy section to the analytic way of slow thinking that your brain uses for solving
    problems. You’re beginning to ask “Why am I feeling this way?”
- Identifying your negative thoughts is the first step in learning how to change the way you
    think, because you’re now learning to always ask “Why do I feel this way?”. When you
    do this, you’re becoming more aware of your habits of thought that make up your
    patterns of fast thinking. You’re learning to identify the beliefs that hold the key to
    changing your emotional life.
- You’re also learning how to use your emotions as keys to unlock the underlying beliefs
    associated with them and bring those beliefs to conscious awareness. This is the first
    step in asking what benefits you get from those beliefs, and whether the beliefs are even
    correct.
- By doing this, you’re continuing to activate nerve cell networks that are the most
    important ones to modify.

If you’re working with a therapist, using the DML to write down your negative thoughts also
starts the process of using writing in your TEAM therapy sessions. (If you used the ideas in the
section on empathy on writing down your story, then you’re continuing to use those skills.) The
use of writing is another important reason for the effectiveness of TEAM therapy. In most
therapies, your therapist writes while you talk. But here you’re also going to do a lot of writing.
This will help you learn more effectively, and is another way that TEAM therapy is aligned with
normal brain function. Using more senses for learning is the most effective way to learn.
Instead of just talking and listening, you’re also using muscle control to write the words down.
You’re using vision as you look at those words, which focuses your attention and awareness.
You’re actively thinking about how much you believe each thought. You’re paying attention to
what you’re writing. In all these ways, you are becoming aware of your negative thoughts.

Writing down your negative thoughts is also critical because it means you don’t have to try to
remember all the information you’ve thought about. Trying to remember all these ideas can be
stressful, and writing them down will decrease that stress.

Once you learn how to do this for one feeling, you can identify negative thoughts for any feeling
you want to work on.

So, write down the negative thoughts in your DML, and write down how much you believe each
one is true. Both of these steps are essential, whether you’re working with a therapist or by
yourself.

```
Negative feelings are the result of negative thoughts. The first
step in changing your feelings is to identify the negative thoughts
that cause those feelings. By bringing them to conscious
awareness and writing them down in the Daily Mood Log, you’re
```

```
activating these nerve cell networks. This step is necessary to
begin modifying them. You’re also becoming aware of the
thoughts that are the cause of your feelings.
```
**_Step 6 : Addressing resistance by discovering awesome things about you revealed by_**

##### negative emotions and negative thoughts

The next component of TEAM therapy is another one of the novel discoveries that makes this
approach so powerful. This discovery combines the element of surprise with the harnessing of
powerful positive emotions. In this step, you’ll modify your nerve cell networks so that your
interpretations of yourself become changed to be much positive. With the combination of
surprise, attention and the generation of positive feelings, you can begin changing your
interpretations and predictions in very beneficial ways.

One of the important roles of this component of TEAM therapy is to address the difficult
challenge that many people with depression or anxiety find out during therapy that they have
some resistance to emotional change. This is called _therapeutic resistance_. Although it
doesn’t come up for everyone, when it does occur it can make recovery much more difficult.
And it’s confusing and frustrating, because the reason you’re seeing a therapist is that you’re
not happy with the emotions you have right now. The unconscious part of your brain, however,
acts as though it’s not so sure about changing these emotions. You don’t know what’s going
on, but it seems like something keeps holding you back from getting to happiness. When you
know in your conscious mind that you want change to happen but your unconscious brain is
resisting that change, you might even start believing that you really are broken and hopeless.

Until TEAM therapy, resistance to change has been a difficult problem to solve. In fact, the
ways that therapists talk and write about it can actually make people feel worse. Most therapists
treat therapeutic resistance as though it’s revealing something wrong with the person in need.
Some therapists talk about people getting some kind of benefit from not changing. Some may
try to talk you out of being resistant. But what it all comes down to is the belief that if you’re
showing therapeutic resistance, it’s because something is wrong with you.

TEAM therapy is very different, and says that resistance occurs because of what’s _right_ about
you, not because of anything that’s wrong. This is another element that helps make TEAM
therapy as powerful as it is.

In this section of the _User’s Guide_ , we’re going to look at the several individual steps you’ll take
to overcome therapeutic resistance. Going through this sequence increases both the speed of
recovery and the number of people for whom TEAM therapy is life-changing.

### MIracle Cures and Magic Buttons

Addressing resistance begins with defining what you hope to accomplish in this session, which
is done by asking the _Miracle Cure_ question. Here, your therapist will ask you if a miracle
happened today, what you would like that to be. (If you’re working by yourself, you can still ask
this question and write down the answer.) This step helps you identify realistic goals. For
example, let’s say that you’re worried about being infected with the Covid-19 virus. You might
want your miracle to be an end to this pandemic, but that’s not something you can accomplish
with TEAM therapy. What you could accomplish, in contrast, would be decreasing your anxiety
about Covid-19 enough so that you could stop feeling panicky and overwhelmed so often.


After you’re defined what you’d like to accomplish, your therapist will ask what you would do if
you could press a button, or wave a wand, that would magically make all of your negative
feelings and negative thoughts disappear without any effort on your part. In _Feeling Great_ , this
button is called the _Magic Button._ If it was that simple to make your negative feelings and
thoughts go away, would you want to press the Magic Button?

Most people say yes to the Magic Button question. Nobody likes having their life filled with
negative feelings, and nobody likes thinking negatively about themselves. Wanting to change
your feelings is the reason you’re working with a therapist.

One problem with pressing the Magic Button, however, is that it won’t change anything in your
life that’s contributing to your negative feelings or negative thoughts. For example, let’s
continue with the example of being worried about a Covid- 19 infection. If you pressed the
Magic Button, Covid-19 would still be just as much of a problem. The only difference is that
you’d stop worrying. Is that a good idea? Maybe not, because you might also stop doing all the
things that are keeping you safe. Many people who get a Covid infection can feel quite sick
(including a smaller percent of cases with very severe illness), and some people have serious
long-term side effects. Being worried about getting infected is a reasonable way to feel, and
motivates you to take sensible precautions.

The Miracle Cure question and the Magic Button question are the first steps that bring you to
another of the important discoveries in TEAM therapy – which is that your negative feelings and
negative thoughts reveal things about you that are beautiful and awesome. This discovery
enables ways of thinking that will help melt away your resistance.

### Positive reframing: Finding out the good things depression and anxiety reveal about you

Before moving on to the next step in melting away your resistance, let’s take a moment to look
at the surprising idea that your negative feelings and thoughts reveal positive things about you.
Here are two examples of how this works:

- Let’s say you have a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). You might
    be washing your hands so often that your skin is raw. You might also be terrified of
    things like touching door handles or stair rails, or the buttons on elevators. Some people
    with OCD spend hours each day in rituals that interfere with their ability to lead a happy
    life.
       What could these behaviors, which are making your life so difficult and unhappy,
    possibly reveal about you that’s good and beautiful? Here are some possibilities: You
    really care about your health because you value life so much. You also care about the
    health of those you love and you don’t want to risk spreading any diseases to them. At
    the same time, you’re being honest about yourself, and admitting that your obsessive
    behavior is a problem interfering with leading a happy life. You’re able to be self-critical,
    and think about whether these behaviors are rational.
- Or let’s say that you’ve been deeply depressed for several years about the death of a
    loved one and just can’t get back to any feelings of happiness. You might even be
    telling yourself that the person who died would want you to feel happiness again, and
    this makes everything even worse because now you feel guilty about still being unhappy.
    Let’s also say that you’ve tried different types of therapy and antidepressants and none
    of them has helped. So, on top of everything else, you’re feeling like you’re broken and
    helpless, and that everything is hopeless.
       Once again, what could these behaviors, which are making your life such an
    unhappy one, possibly reveal about you that’s awesome and beautiful? Here are some
    possibilities: Your unhappiness is an expression of your love for the person who died.
    You care about the beauty of life, and believe that it’s something sacred and special.


```
You care about others, and value their company. You don’t want to be alone, and are
honest with yourself about your desire to be close to others. You also know that you
want to experience happiness again, and want to learn how to do this. And feeling
hopeless also can keep you from being disappointed if the next therapy you try doesn’t
work.
```
```
Those are just some examples of the beautiful and awesome things about you revealed by your
negative feelings and thoughts. There are many more that you’ll be able to identify as you learn
to do this. When you identify your positive virtues, you’re going to write them down in your
DML, right by where you’ve written your negative thoughts. It may take a few tries to get the
hang of doing this, but your therapist will help you. There are also lots of useful tips in Feeling
Great (pages 182-198) on how to identify positive virtues revealed by your negative thoughts
and feelings.
```
```
Filling out this part of the DML will look like this:
```
```
The identification of beautiful and awesome things about you revealed by your negative
thoughts and feelings is called positive reframing. It’s a powerful way to learn about the many
virtues that are easy to ignore when you’re depressed or anxious. You’re creating a new internal
story that says that you’re not broken or defective.
```
```
Learning how to do positive reframing is another way that TEAM therapy uses your slow
analytical thinking to learn something new and modify your nerve cell networks. When you do
this, you’re solving a novel problem that requires your attention and awareness. Your curiosity
will be stimulated by learning something new. You’ll be learning good things about yourself,
which is a positive and enjoyable experience. Moreover, the way in which your therapist will
work with you will let you discover these positive virtues by yourself, which makes the learning
more effective.
```
```
You carry out positive reframing by asking three questions about the negative emotion or the
negative thought:
```
1. _Is the feeling or thought appropriate?_ Some negative feelings and thoughts may be
    healthy ones. If you’re sad because of the death of someone you loved, for example,
    being sad and grieving is a healthy response.
2. _What does the feeling or thought show about my core values that’s beautiful or_
    _awesome?_ To use the same example, they might show your ability to love others, and
    your desire not to be alone.
3. _How might the negative feeling or thought be of some benefit to you_? Keeping with the
    same example, it keeps alive the memory of the person who died.

```
When you work with the DML, you start out by writing down your negative thoughts and how much you
believe they’re true. Then you identify the positive virtues revealed by that negative thought.
```

### Positive reframing gives you the information you need to melt away resistance

The association of positive virtues with your negative feelings and thoughts is another reason
why pressing the Magic Button is not such a good idea. If all these awesome things about you
are connected to your negative thoughts, then maybe all those good things would also
disappear if you pressed the Magic Button.

What TEAM therapists think could be happening in therapeutic resistance is that your
subconscious mind recognizes that your negative feelings and thoughts are connected to many
of your best characteristics. Perhaps your subconscious mind recognizes that just getting rid of
the negative feelings and thoughts might also get rid of what’s best about you.

Another way to think about therapeutic resistance could be that the purpose of your negative
feelings is to protect you from harm. This is the job of your amygdala, and or other parts of your
limbic system, which are parts of your brain that protect you from potential danger. Although it
may not always feel this way, your limbic system loves you. It’s not trying to make you
miserable. Instead, it’s sending out signals that something seems wrong.

Negative feelings are information that your amygdala and limbic system use to get your
attention. If you ignore those warnings (which you experience as negative emotions) your
limbic system will generate even stronger negative emotions until you pay attention. This will
cause more stress, which will make it harder to use your prefrontal cortex and do the slow
analytical thinking needed to learn new information and modify your nerve cell networks.

Fortunately, TEAM therapists have discovered ways to solve these problems, and to change
your negative emotions without giving up any of the positive virtues connected to them.

The most important question, though, is whether you still want to change your emotions now
that you know that your negative feelings and thoughts reveal wonderful things about you. Your
therapist will ask you what you’d like to do, and suggest that maybe you’d prefer to keep holding
on to the negative thoughts and feelings.

How do you feel about that choice? Most people come to therapy to decrease their negative
feelings. Seeing the beautiful things about you associated with your negative thoughts and
feelings might make you wonder about whether to do this. You can talk about this question with
your therapist, and you also can see how you feel if they try and convince you not to change.

If you still want to change, then you can move on to the next step. You might also decide that
you’d rather work on something else. The choice is up to you, and your therapist will support
you for whichever choice you make.

_Using a Magic Dial to decrease the intensity of your negative feelings while keeping all your
positive virtues_

What if you could learn how to decrease the intensity of your negative feelings but still keep all
the virtues they reveal? Is that a choice you might like?

If you do decide to go ahead and work for emotional change, your therapist will ask you if you’d
like to use a _Magic Dial_ instead of a Magic Button. The Magic Dial is different from the Magic
Button because it doesn’t make the negative feelings and negative thoughts just disappear.
Instead, it lets you decrease their intensity to a level that makes sense to you. When you do
that, you still get to keep all the positive virtues you identified by doing positive reframing.


```
35
```
```
Basically, it’s like saying to your limbic system that you’re paying attention to the warnings and
you’re figuring out what your limbic system is trying to tell you. Because you’re paying attention
to the warnings, it’s okay to turn down the volume of your alarm system.
```
```
To use the Magic Dial, you choose the intensity of feelings that make sense to you, and write
those down as your goals. You can set those goals at any intensity of emotions that feels right
for you. When you do this, you’re creating a new internal story. Instead of believing that your
emotions are something you’re stuck with, you learn that you actually can choose the intensity
of these emotions.
```
```
The Magic Dial introduces still another element of surprise, which is finding out that you can
actually dial down the volume of your negative feelings while keeping any important information
they provide. This once again is a surprise associated with attention and the generation of
positive feelings, which all enhances your ability to learn these new ideas.
```
```
TEAM therapists have discovered that when you change your thoughts in this way, your
resistance will start to disappear. It’s as though you’ve done a deal with your subconscious
mind to let it know that you’re paying attention to the warnings and that you’re keeping all the
good stuff. When you do this, your subconscious no longer has to be resistant to change.
```
```
There are also other reasons why people may have some resistance to changing their
emotions. For example, it can seem disrespectful to claim that rapid emotional change can
occur if someone is sick with a terrible illness, like cancer or motor neuron disease, or if they’ve
been in therapy for many years. It can seem like the emotional trauma they’re feeling, and their
serious medical problems, are being minimized or ignored. This can create or increase
resistance by making people feel like their very real needs are being dismissed.
```
```
If identifying the positive virtues revealed by your negative feelings and thoughts isn’t enough to
eliminate resistance, then TEAM therapists are trained in multiple other ways to help solve this
challenge. Learning how to recognize the wonderful things about you revealed by your negative
feelings and thoughts is critical, however, in making TEAM therapy so effective.

the intensity of your negative
feelings. 1. At the start of the session,
your negative feelings are powerful.

choose goals for emotional intensities
that are less powerful, and that feel
right for you. 3. When you’ve
completed TEAM therapy, the
intensity of your negative feelings
will decrease to the level of your goals,
and usually even more. During this
whole time, you’ll always also get to
keep the positive virtues revealed by
those negative feelings.**

Identifying the positive virtues revealed by your negative feelings and thoughts also has other
benefits. For example, along with getting the Magic Dial, you’re also being given a Magic
Mirror. When you’re depressed or anxious for a long time, thinking about yourself is like having
a mirror that only lets you see parts of yourself that you don’t like. Now your mirror will work
differently. The way in which you think about yourself is going to change dramatically because
you’ll start seeing that there are many good things about you.

When you’re learning to recognize the positive traits revealed by your negative feelings and
thoughts, you’re also modifying the nerve cell networks that are your negative feelings and
beliefs. You’re doing this by attaching them to other networks that are your positive thoughts.

Soon, because what fires together wires together, whenever you think of your negative
thoughts, you’ll also activate the networks associated with your positive virtues. Every time you
do this, the connections to your positive virtues will get stronger. Because what’s wired
together fires together, doing this will become a way that you automatically think. This new way
of thinking will become part of your fast thinking habits.

As you go through the steps of addressing resistance, you’ll create new habits of thinking that
always remind you of the beautiful and awesome things about you revealed by your negative
feelings. Instead of just feeling like you want to get rid of them, they become interesting clues
that reveal what’s good and right about you.

Still another benefit of learning positive reframing is that you’re also going to be in a great place
to really enjoy practicing between sessions. Your therapist might call it homework, but instead of
feeling like it’s something you don’t want to do, it’s practicing something that will lift your spirits
and change your life. You’re learning how to take a new look at yourself. You’re learning that
you can dial down the volume on your alarm system without losing the benefits of having a

warning system. No other homework was ever this much fun, or had this much ability to change
your life.

And there’s still more fun to be had in the next step.

```
One of the discoveries that makes TEAM therapy so effective is the finding
that your negative feelings and negative thoughts reveal awesome and
beautiful things about you. Identifying those positive virtues has the
surprising effect of enabling you to decrease – and even eliminate –
therapeutic resistance. Addressing resistance in this way helps TEAM
therapy work more quickly and for larger numbers of people.
```
```
There’s a sequence of steps developed by TEAM therapists to help you
change your internal story by finding out that you’re not broken or
defective. The Miracle Question, the Magic Button, positive reframing and
using the Magic Dial let you discover that you can decrease your negative
feelings and still keep all the positive virtues that are associated with
them.
```
```
By going through this sequence, you’re firing together nerve cell networks
that represent your negative thoughts with ones that represent your
positive virtues. Doing this will wire them together and create new habits
of thought that reveal ways in which your brain is working correctly and
show you that you’re not broken.
```
## Step 7: Are your negative thoughts accurate?

Our brains are amazing, but they’re not perfect. We all have lots of flaws in our thinking.
Sometimes we believe something because it makes us feel good. We might believe something
because our friends or family believe it. Or we might believe it because we’ve thought it was
true for a long time, or for many other reasons that don’t have anything to do with whether it’s
accurate.

At the same time, the ability of the brain to help keep us alive is based on choosing the most
accurate interpretations of the world. Correct interpretations lead to more accurate predictions,
and accurate predictions increase the likelihood of staying alive.

Fortunately, one of our special human talents is the ability to analyze our thoughts using slow
analytical thinking. This is part of how we carry out a quality control check on our interpretations.
Every advance in science, in engineering, and in medicine (including the development of TEAM
therapy!) is because of asking if our interpretations are accurate. If we find out they’re not, that
can be disturbing – but it’s also the path to more accurate beliefs and interpretations.

Analyzing the thoughts of people with depression or anxiety reveals that a lot of their negative
thoughts are not accurate. This discovery is another of the keys to the effectiveness of TEAM
therapy.

In general, the amount you believe in your negative thoughts depends on whether or not you
think they’re correct. After all, if you analyze a thought and decide it’s not correct, then it’s less
likely that you’ll keep believing it.

That’s why the next step in TEAM therapy is to find out if your negative thoughts are based on
flawed reasoning. This is an easy skill to learn, particularly because there are only a dozen
thinking errors that keep showing up in people with depression or anxiety. These thinking errors


```
38
```
```
also occur in all of us. We’ve all probably experienced every one of them at one time or
another. But they occur more often in depression and anxiety.
In TEAM therapy, and in Feeling Great , the thinking errors are called cognitive distortions. Other
people might call them irrational thinking, and others use other descriptions. What we call them
isn’t important. The question that matters is whether or not your negative thoughts are based on
patterns of thinking that are not accurate and that don’t lead to helpful answers.
The way you do this next step is to pick a negative thought to work on and see if you can find
any distorted reasoning in that thought. This is the quality control step that we discussed in the
first part of this guide, in the section on how your emotions are generated.
The list of the kinds of thinking errors that occur in depression and anxiety is found at the end of
your Daily Mood Log, and is also shown below. All of Part II of Feeling Great is focused on
explaining these distortions. In addition, discussion of cognitive distortions occurs in almost
every feelinggood podcast, with some podcasts focusing the entire session on understanding a
single distortion^8.
```
```
Most thinking errors are straightforward and easy to understand. They include errors like all-or-
nothing thinking, where you think that something (including yourself) is either perfect or it’s no
good at all. Another common thinking error in depression and anxiety is mind-reading, where
you’re convinced that other people are thinking bad things about you. There’s also fortune-
telling (where you predict that something bad is going to happen without any evidence the
prediction is accurate), discounting the positive (where you ignore anything good that is
happening) and several others. If you have questions about any of these thinking errors and
how to identify them, your therapist can help you understand anything you’re not sure about.
What happens when you identify cognitive distortions in your negative thoughts is powerful. By
identifying ways in which your negative thoughts are based on irrational thinking, your brain will
automatically compare the less accurate negative interpretations and predictions with the more

cognitive distortion.

accurate positive interpretations and predictions you were revealing during positive reframing.
As it does this, it will automatically start the process of changing your beliefs and interpretations
to the ones that are more accurate.

By working with the DML, you’re laying out all the information your brain needs right in front of
you. You’ve written down the negative thoughts, and also written down positive thoughts that
have the power to crush the negative ones. Now you’re also writing down the cognitive
distortions. All this information is organized in a way that makes it easy for your brain to do its
job and check whether your interpretations need to change.

```
Working with the Daily Mood Journal modifies your nerve cell networks so
that your negative thoughts become wired together with your positive
virtues and with the ability to identify distorted thinking. In Step 1,
you’ll identify negative thoughts connected with your negative feelings.
This will activate nerve cell networks that need to be modified, and that
represent powerful negative thoughts. In Step 2, positive reframing
modifies the negative networks by attaching them to networks representing
your positive virtues. In Step 3, you’ll learn to identify distorted thinking
in your negative thoughts. This attaches your negative thoughts to nerve
cell networks used for quality control of your interpretations. After you’ve
done this a few times, you’ll be able to easily identify positive virtues
revealed by each negative thought and negative feeling. You’ll also be able
to identify thinking errors in your negative thoughts. As you go through
these steps, your negative thoughts will become less intense and your belief
in them will decrease.

```
```
As you work on this step, your therapist will ask you how much you still believe that the negative
thought is true. Most often, your belief in that negative thought will have decreased - even
though you believed it was totally true just a short time ago. You might even decide that the
negative thought is not true at all. You’ll write down how much you believe in the negative
thought in the DML. When you crush the negative thought that you chose to start on, then you’ll
move to the next one and do the same thing.
```
```
Once again, TEAM therapy uses surprise to enhance your learning. Before you started this
work, you believed in your negative thoughts completely. Now, you’re learning how to figure out
if they’re flawed, and you’re finding out that most – and perhaps all – of them contain multiple
thinking errors.
```
```
If your belief in the negative thought that you’re working on stays high, there are several
possibilities to consider. For example:
```
- You might re-examine the thought from a different perspective. Go back to empathy and
    share what you think is important about that thought.
- Sometimes it helps to break the thought down into smaller pieces and work on them
    individually.
- You can approach the thought with different methods, something that you’ll hear happen
    frequently in live sessions. Sometimes this is done by first explaining the method, and
    sometimes it’s done in such a smooth way that it sounds like the normal flow of the
    conversation. Not everybody responds to the same methods, and the advantage of
    having so many to work with is that you will eventually find one that works for you. The
    methods you’ll chose are not random, and specific techniques are better suited to
    particular kinds of problems. A guide as to which techniques are particularly useful in
    different situations is found in _Feeling Great_ , on pages 106 - 107.
- Perhaps working on that thought is making you anxious, and is activating your defense
    mechanisms. As we’ve discussed, this would suppress the prefrontal cortex, and make
    it harder to analyze that thought. If you’re focused on defending yourself, then you’re
    also going to be resistant to change.
- Whatever the reason is for the difficulties in changing your belief in that thought, you can
    also choose to change the focus and revisit it later, and work on something else right
    now.
- It’s also important to consider the possibility that the negative thought is a healthy one.
    For example, you might start out believing 90-100% that if you go out to meet some
    friends that you’re going to get infected with Covid-19. If you’ve been fully vaccinated,
    are careful about wearing a mask, and are outside, then it’s unlikely that you’ll get
    infected. But it might not be healthy to drop that belief to 0% and act like there is no risk
    at all that you could get COVID-19. It would still be healthy thinking to recognize there’s
    some possibility of infection, and to act appropriately. Another example of a healthy

Working with the DML lets you look at all the information about a negative thought at one time. The
thought, the positive virtues revealed by that thought and the cognitive distortions in the thought are all
easy to look at together. This makes it easier for your brain to do the quality control analysis needed to
change how much you believe in the negative thought. (AON = all-or-nothing thinking; OG = over-
generalization; MF = mental filter; DP = discounting the positive; ER = emotional reasoning

```
negative thought might be that you’re sad about the death of someone you loved. Your
sadness may be a celebration of your love for the person who died. If the negative
thought is a healthy one, then maybe you don’t want to decrease your belief in it, but
instead need to look at it from a different perspective.
```
Once your brain carries out its quality control check on your interpretations and predictions, and
chooses the more accurate positive interpretations, you’ve set the stage for rapid emotional
change as a part of your normal brain function. Emotions are reactions to interpretations and
predictions; change the interpretations and predictions and your emotions will change. That’s
what our brains are built to do.

Given a choice between interpretations and predictions that are emotionally positive and are
more accurate _versus_ interpretations and predictions that are emotionally negative and are less
accurate, our brains will choose the positive and accurate ones. That’s also what our brains are
built to do. The power of TEAM therapy lies in using carefully constructed steps and slow
analytical thinking to bring those comparisons into the open. When you do this, the normal
functions of your brain create emotional change.

Learning how to identify cognitive distortions also will make homework practice even more fun.
When you identify wonderful things about you revealed by your negative feelings and thoughts
and you also identify cognitive distortions in your negative thoughts, your feelings will change.
Once you see that you can change your belief in one negative thought, you’ll realize you can do
this for other negative thoughts. If you do this for fifteen minutes a day, your brain will learn to
automatically change your interpretations and change your emotions. You’ll learn new patterns
of thought that become a much healthier type of fast thinking. That’s the best homework ever!

_Some brief comments on the meaning of “should statements”:_

Once you learn how to identify cognitive distortions, it’s always easy to find thinking errors in
your negative thoughts.

There is one distortion, however, that’s worth a few comments because many people find it
puzzling – and that is _should statements._ Why are these distorted thinking when they sound
harmless, and people use them so often?

It turns out that should statements are one of the most powerful causes of unhappiness. We
convince ourselves the world “should” work in a certain way and we’re unhappy when it doesn’t.
We tell ourselves that there’s something wrong with us or with someone else. “I should have
done better,” for example, is the same as “I’m not good enough.” “They should not have done
that to me” is the same as “they’re bad because of what they did to me.”

Should statements are confusing because we use the same word to talk about some things that
are true and some things that are opinions. There are three valid kinds of _should statements_
that are true. One is a “physical law of the universe” should statement, such as “If you drop an
apple, it should fall to the floor because of gravity.” There are also legal should statements, such
as “You should stop at a stop sign, or you’re going to get a ticket.” There are also moral should
statements that almost everybody agrees on. For example, almost everyone agrees that you
should not murder someone.

Aside from those three kinds of should statements, all of the others are just different opinions.
People have different opinions on a lot of topics, such as appropriate or attractive ways to dress,
who it’s okay to love, and many other topics. When we talk about these kinds of should
statements, we could easily say “I think it would be preferable to wear this choice of clothes,”
and that would be more accurate than “I should wear this choice of clothes”. In contrast, it


makes no sense to say “I think it would be preferable if a dropped apple falls to the floor.”
That’s what the apple is going to do no matter what anyone thinks.

```
With these simple steps, you’ve used the natural laws of learning and the
brain function of slow analytical thinking to modify nerve cell networks
central to understanding the cause of your unhappiness. Remember that
part of learning occurs because “what fires together wires together.” You
learned that your negative thoughts and feelings reveal many beautiful and
awesome things about you. With that step, you’re using your slow
analytical thinking skills to connect networks that represent your negative
thoughts to other ones that represent your positive virtues.
```
```
By learning how to identify cognitive distortions in your negative thoughts,
you’re also modifying these nerve cell networks still more. This time,
you’re attaching them to the networks that let you identify cognitive
distortions.
```
```
By firing all of these networks together, you’ve wired them together. Now,
when a negative thought is activated, it’s connected to positive thought
networks revealing what’s awesome about you. It’s also connected to
other networks that decrease your belief in the negative thoughts even
more by finding the distorted thinking in them. You have built new and
healthier patterns of fast thinking.
```
```
Another law of learning is that what’s wired together fires together. By
using your new skills on multiple negative thoughts, you’re making
connections between all these networks even stronger. This means that
every time you have a negative thought, those networks will fire together
with the networks representing your positive virtues and your new ability
to identify cognitive distortions.
```
```
The goal of TEAM therapy is to free you from the maze of depression,
anxiety, or other emotional challenges. Modifying your nerve cell networks
by combining positive reframing and identification of cognitive distortions
will help you leave the darkness of your maze.
```

Combining positive reframing with identification of cognitive distortions is
a bit like getting ready to fly in a lighter-than-air balloon. Positive reframing
is what inflates the balloon that can carry you on your flight over beautiful
landscapes to new lands. Identifying the cognitive distortions is how you
throw off the ballast bags and ropes that keep you on the ground even
when the balloon is inflated.
```
**_Step 8: The Methods of TEAM enhance rapid progress, personalize your therapy,_**

##### all the information you’ve learned thus far, and help prevent relapses

You’ve accomplished a lot at this point, and you may even be starting to feel pretty good, but
we’re not done yet. The goals of TEAM therapy are to enable recovery that is complete and
that will last. Your TEAM therapist wants to be the last therapist you’ll ever need. The next step
is important in achieving these goals.

The next step involves a focused use of Methods, the M in TEAM. For many people, emotional
change is already in full swing by the time they’ve completed the DML. You’ve brought
information you need to conscious awareness and you’ve modified multiple networks of nerve
cells.

You’ve learned a lot already, but this next step will make comparisons between correct and
incorrect thoughts even easier. If your emotions haven’t changed yet, then this step can help
bring you across the finish line. And even if you’re already feeling pretty good, learning some of
the TEAM methods is a chance to put what you’ve learned into practice so that you’re ready to
respond if you hit a bump in the road later on.

The Methods of TEAM are important in multiple ways:

- _Tuning therapy to your unique needs_ : The TEAM therapy toolkit includes over 100
    different techniques, taken from multiple fields and approaches.^9 These include multiple
    novel techniques that Dr. Burns and his colleagues have developed over many years of
    working with people with a broad range of different needs and personalities. Moreover,
    TEAM therapists love coming up with new methods and sharing them with each other,
    so the list of techniques is constantly growing. The only criterion for whether a method is
    included is whether it’s helpful.
       Having so many different methods means that TEAM therapy can be tailored to the
    unique needs of every individual. This is another important aspect of TEAM therapy. If
    you work with a therapist who’s aligned with a particular school of thought, and that
    approach doesn’t work for you, you’ll likely need to find a new therapist. This is much
    less of a concern if you’re working with someone trained in TEAM therapy because any
    technique that is useful can be integrated into the TEAM approach.
- _Solving challenges:_ The Methods of TEAM therapy are used in multiple ways to help
    solve challenges and to dive deeper into your thoughts and emotions. They can be
    incorporated into therapy sessions at any time they’re needed. Sometimes they’re
    introduced as a method, but often they’re just integrated into the flow of the session.
    From the beginning of a session until its completion, the methods of TEAM are used to
    help in therapeutic progress.

(^9) Fifty of these are discussed in detail in _Feeling Great_ Chapter 33, and you can learn many
more by listening to podcasts. Whatever your level of interest, the podcasts are invaluable. If
you’re interested in the origins of many the techniques, this is discussed at
(https://feelinggood.libsyn.com/website/184-what-comes-first-negative-thoughts-or-feelings-
solving-the-chicken-vs-the-egg-problem-and-more )


- _Consolidating and amplifying what you’ve learned_ : The most exciting use of methods,
    however, is to consolidate the gains made in the DML. They are the way you practice
    your new knowledge. Using various methods at the end of your therapy session to
    consolidate and amplify what you’ve learned are also an important reason why TEAM
    therapy is so powerful.
       Whether or not they’ve been used earlier, various methods always are used at the
    end of treatment to consolidate and strengthen all the changes that have taken place
    during cognitive reframing and identification of cognitive distortions. They’re also used in
    relapse training, where you learn how to rapidly defeat any unhappiness that might occur
    in the future.
- _Experiencing joy:_ One of the most impressive things about the methods of TEAM
    therapy is that they can be fun to use. You’ll hear that in live sessions on the
    [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com) podcasts, and you’ll hopefully experience it when you use the
    methods yourself. Using the methods of TEAM can be filled with joy, which makes this
    part of the journey still more positive and rewarding at the same time it reinforces that
    you’re not broken or defective.

So, what are these wonderful methods? I’m sorry to say that one challenge of having over 100
methods to consider is that a document like the _User’s Guide_ is too short to dive into them
individually. Fortunately, we don’t have to do that because _Feeling Great_ has descriptions of 50
different powerful methods to use in Chapter 33, there are multiple podcasts devoted to
particular methods, and every live session podcast uses appropriate methods as needed.

Thus, I’m going to restrain myself here, and refer to you the many other resources available to
you, and to your therapist (if you’re working with one – if not, I’ll circle back to using the methods
on your own at the end of this section).

We do have time, however, to take a moment to look at what the methods might do from the
perspective of brain function. If something works, it’s because it’s aligned with how your brain
works. What are the methods doing from this perspective?

From the perspective of brain function, no matter how different they appear, the methods of
TEAM all share certain features:

1. All of the methods promote comparison between your flawed, negative, and mean-
    spirited thoughts and your more valid and compassionate thoughts. All of the methods
    help your brain carry out the quality control step that is so important in changing your
    interpretations and predictions. This is the step that will automatically change your
    emotions.
       Regardless of when the Methods of TEAM therapy are used, or which ones are
    used, their power depends on their ability to accentuate comparisons between stronger
    positive interpretations and weaker negative interpretations. Once this comparison is set
    up, emotional change is the natural consequence of choosing interpretations that yield
    accurate predictions and let you feel better about yourself.
2. The methods all amplify and solidify what you’ve learned, and extend the changes that
    have occurred thus far.
3. If you still have emotional monsters that are troubling you, there are methods to help you
    master them.
4. The methods of TEAM will build and strengthen new networks by the principle of what
    fires together wires together. Once these new nerve cell networks have been
    strengthened, then the principle of what’s wired together fires together increases the
    likelihood that they’ll continue to work together. Whether you’re again wrestling with
    depression and/or anxiety, or just dealing with the many different stresses that that can
    weigh each of us down, you will have created an emotional defense system that can
    neutralize harmful thinking before it becomes toxic to your health.


5. As with so many other components of TEAM therapy, the methods of TEAM can lead
    you to many positive surprises as you see how they work, and learn powerful new ways
    of responding to your negative thoughts.

_Building your Recovery Circle_

In working with Methods at the end of a session, the starting place is to use what’s called a
Recovery Circle ( _Feeling Great,_ pgs. 203-205). To use this circle, choose a negative thought to
work on and put it in the center of the Circle.^10 On the outside of the circle, you list the
techniques you think might be useful, and work your way through them.^11 If the first technique
doesn’t work then you move on to the next one until the belief in the negative thought is reduced
to zero (or at least close to zero). It’s rarely necessary, but if you need to then it’s possible to
work though fifteen techniques in a half hour or so.^12

useful for each kind of cognitive distortion ( _pg 106-107)._

Having multiple techniques to draw on is an optimistic message that also is important in
understanding the power of TEAM therapy. Displaying multiple methods right in the beginning of
this part of the therapeutic journey shows you that it’s not a problem if a particular approach isn’t
working, because there are plenty of other options. Moreover, the confidence that there’s a well
thought out plan is also promoted by knowing that if a particular method doesn’t work, the goal
is to find that out as quickly as possible and then move on and identify the right one for you. It’s
okay if a method doesn’t work for you, because we’re all different in our personal experiences. If
a particular method doesn’t work, you just move on the next one.

The straightforward and rapid way in which the success or failure of a method is determined is
another positive aspect of TEAM therapy. If you’re using a method to solve a knotty problem on
decreasing belief in a negative thought, for example it’s easy to tell if the method worked or not
because you’re quantifying how much you believe in that thought. If the belief in the negative
thought in the center of the circle goes down, then the technique is working. If your belief in the
negative thought stays high, then move on to another technique. If your belief in that thought
decreases to zero, or close to zero, then you can move on to the next negative thought.

_Working by yourself:_

When you’re using the methods of TEAM therapy by yourself, the most powerful approach is to
write everything down as though you were working with a therapist. As discussed earlier,
writing has special effects on your thinking, and will help clarify your thoughts in useful ways.
Writing out the conversation you’d be having if you were working with someone, with what you’d
say in each role, is the quickest way to become proficient at these methods.

For those methods that use role playing, another way that people work on Methods by
themselves is to say each role out loud. You can do this however you like. You can put one role
on your left shoulder, and one on your right and let them talk in turn. You can shift your body
language between the different roles, speak in different voices, or whatever works for you. The
goal is to get the information you need out in front of you. Any way you do this will build the
nerve cell networks and patterns of thought that enable you to do this successfully time after
time.

## Step 9: Relapse training

Another aspect of TEAM therapy that differs from other approaches is the way that the problem
of relapses is handled.^13 Relapses in the treatment of depression and anxiety, with the return of
the feelings that made you seek out therapy, are a frequent problem. Symptoms can return in
stressful situations, or they can return without a known cause. For most people, relapses are
frightening experiences that can cause you to doubt yourself so much that you conclude that
you really are defective and hopeless. You may feel that the success you had was just a
delusion, that you’re so defective that nothing is going to really help, and you may feel helpless
and afraid. These feelings are even more severe because you’ve had some time when you
were feeling pretty good about yourself.

(^13) More information on relapse training can be found in Section IV of _Feeling Great_ , and in
multiple other podcasts, such as _https://feelinggood.com/2017/07/31/048-relapse-prevention-
training/_


The goals of TEAM therapy are not just to achieve complete recovery but to also prevent
relapses in the future. To achieve recovery that lasts, TEAM therapy provides specific training
to prepare you for the future. Psychotherapy is not like taking antibiotics for an infection, where
the goal is to eliminate the pathogen. It’s more like taking care of your bicycle or car. You don’t
repair your bike or your car once with the expectation that you’re done forever. It’s important to
pay attention to maintenance, and relapse training teaches you how to do this.

For most types of psychotherapy, and for medication-centered treatment, relapses are
considered challenging to treat. It’s generally believed that each new episode will be more
severe than earlier ones, and therapeutic strategies are uncertain. If your therapist is also
worried about the consequences of a relapse, this will probably increase your fear of such an
event.

TEAM therapy has a very different view of relapses, and actually treats a relapse as a positive
event. In fact, relapse training generally begins with an introduction along the lines of “I’ve got
some good news, some great news and some really great news. The _good news_ is that at
some point you’re going to have a relapse. The reason this is good news is that it shows that
your brain is working normally. Life has ups and downs for all of us, and no one is entitled to
seven happy days a week. So, the fact that you might feel down again just shows that you’re
human. The _great news_ is that the techniques you used today will work for you every time you
need them in the future. And the _really great news_ is that now you’re able to do this on your
own. These techniques are part of your new skill set. And if you need a refresher, you can do
some review work with _Feeling Great_ or check back in with your therapist for a quick tune-up.”

Instead of being afraid of a relapse, people trained in the techniques of TEAM therapy welcome
the chance to test out their skills. It’s exciting instead of frightening, because you know you’re
going to come out of it okay, and you can enjoy what you’re now able to do. You’re not
helpless, because you now have powerful techniques you can use whenever you need them.
The situation no longer feels hopeless.

Moreover, every time you successfully defeat a relapse, the principles of “what fires together
wires together” and “what’s wired together fires together” work in your favor to make all of your
new skills even more powerful. Doing this also will give you examples of how you overcame the
relapse, making it even easier to do this if you have to do it again.

_Defining a relapse_

One of the ways that TEAM therapy helps you defeat relapses is that it defines a relapse as one
minute or more of unhappiness, whenever it occurs. Every life has its ups and downs, and
nobody gets to be happy every minute of every day.

Defining a relapse as one minute or more of unhappiness also is part of why TEAM therapy is
so powerful. Defining a relapse this way accomplishes two important goals:

- _Taking away the fear:_ Defining a relapse in this way decreases the fear by presenting it
    as just a normal part of being alive. It takes away the feeling of being ambushed by
    something unexpected. Now, having a relapse is a prediction that every life has some
    unhappy moments. Other approaches treat relapse as a fearful process that can drag
    you even further into the depths than you were when you first sought help. In contrast,
    TEAM therapy treats periods of unhappiness and self-doubt as a part of life that you now
    know how to handle. You’re prepared to react because you were warned in advance,
    and you know what to do.
- _Early treatment is more effective:_ Defining even a minute of unhappiness as a relapse
    encourages you to apply the TEAM therapy techniques you’ve learned as quickly as


```
possible, with the goal of preventing further progression. If you define a relapse as
occurring as soon as you start being unhappy, then unhappiness is a reminder to use
techniques that will prevent it from becoming severe. Basically, you're fixing the wobble
on the wheels of your brain when the wobble first starts. This is just like you’d do with a
bicycle or a car, and your brain is a lot more important than your bicycle or car.
```
```
TEAM therapy differs from other therapies by training you to
respond quickly and effectively to possible relapses. All the
skills that helped you the first time will be just as effective if
you need them again. In addition, by defining a relapse as a
minute or more of unhappiness, you’ll make those skills even
more effective by using them as soon as you need them.
```
## Step 10: Evaluation: how did the session go?

How do you know what progress you’ve made? Whether improvements are going to last? How
do you know what changes to make so that your therapy more effective? One of the unique
features of TEAM therapy is that these questions are addressed in a way that enables accurate
analysis of each one. This is still another way in which every step in TEAM therapy has been
thought out with great precision.

Every TEAM therapy session ends with filling out two forms that are very quick to use. Both
forms also help your therapist know how well they’re helping you. These forms also
demonstrate additional important differences between TEAM therapy and other treatments:

- The first form to fill out is the Brief Mood Survey again, to find out how well the therapy
    session went.
- The second form is an Evaluation of Therapy form. This is also used after every session.
    It just takes a couple of minutes to fill out, and it provides critical information to your
    therapist on multiple topics to improve their ability to be helpful to you.

On a general level, the information in the Brief Mood Survey helps you chart your own progress,
and helps increase your awareness of your emotions. But there are multiple other reasons why
returning to the Brief Mood Survey is important:

- Filling out the Brief Mood Survey at the beginning and end of every session is essential
    in determining whether you are experiencing rapid change and whether these changes
    are maintained from one session to the next.
       It only makes sense to check this information at the beginning and end of every
    session if there is an expectation of making progress during each session and of
    retaining the improvement from one session to the next. These expectations represent
    big differences from other therapies.
       Achieving more rapid recovery than occurs in other forms of psychotherapy is one
    of the goals of TEAM therapy. The recovery in a single two-hour session that you can
    listen to on podcasts is something that requires years of experience with TEAM therapy,
    and such single-session treatment is not a realistic goal for most therapists. Rapid
    recovery, however, is the goal of all TEAM therapists.
- When you fill out the Brief Mood Survey at the beginning and end of every session, you’ll
    hopefully see real evidence of change. When people fill this survey out at the end of a
    successful session, they’re often amazed at how much their emotions changed. Seeing
    change in such a clear way will strengthen your feelings of hopefulness and optimism
    and your belief that it’s possible to gain control over your emotional state.
- The use of measuring tools for your emotions (and also your beliefs) takes TEAM
    therapy out of the realm of ambiguous questions like “How are you feeling?” and
    ambiguous answers like “Pretty well, I guess, but kind of down and a bit anxious.” The


```
tools of TEAM therapy put numerical values on your feelings and beliefs, which makes it
possible to see how much each one has changed.
```
- The information in the Brief Mood Survey is also critical in seeing what adjustments are
    needed in your therapy. This information is important in evaluating how treatment is
    going. It also identifies specific goals to be addressed. The tools used for depression,
    anxiety, relationship issues, habits and addictions have lots of similarities, but they also
    have important differences. If your scores are changing in one area but not in another,
    then knowing this information can help your therapist adjust the therapy precisely
    according to your needs.

The Evaluation of Therapy form is another unique feature of TEAM therapy. This form has
multiple ways of providing feedback to your therapist:

- The empathy part of the Evaluation of Therapy form is one way that you give feedback
    to your therapist. There is a 20 point scoring range for the evaluation of therapy, and the
    only passing grade is a perfect score of 20 points. That is a tremendous challenge for
    any therapist to meet, but it’s the only way for your therapist to know if they’re
    understanding your needs. This is like giving your therapist a grade at the end of the
    empathy session, but now you’re able to reflect on the entire session.
- The Evaluation of Therapy form also has sections on helpfulness of the session,
    satisfaction, your commitment, negative feelings and difficulties with the session. Every
    one of these topics requires a perfect score to be considered a success for the therapist.
- This form also asks what you liked least and what you liked best about the session.
    These questions give you the opportunity to provide specific feedback.

Dr. Burns has described multiple sessions, in his books and podcasts, in which he wrongly
thought he had done a wonderful job. It was only by reading the end-of-session feedback from
the patient that he found out that he had actually done a terrible job. This information allowed
him to understand how he failed, and to do better. There have also been times of feeling he
had done a terrible job, yet the patient was thrilled. But the times he failed were the most useful
because this is when there was the chance to find out where he’d gone wrong. This feedback
was what created the chance to change direction and improve.

```
The closing evaluation of your emotions and of the therapy session
at the end of every session are unique features of TEAM therapy
that also help explain its effectiveness. The information in these
forms is what enables fine tuning of your therapy for your individual
needs. These forms provide precise information on your emotional
state. They also provide precise information on the way you feel
about each and every session.
```
```
For every other branch of medicine, having precise information is
essential. In fact, all of science is based on our ability to measure
outcomes. Without such information, all interpretations are just
guessing. They are influenced by a person’s own internal stories,
their moods of the moment, and other factors. In other branches of
medicine, the idea that you could monitor someone’s recovery
without accurate testing would be considered insane. For
psychotherapy to be carried out in a scientific way, the need for
accurate measurements is just as strong.
```
```
Once you start using the quantitative evaluation tools used in TEAM
therapy, it becomes difficult to imagine why anyone would do
anything else. Similarly, once you start working with quantitative
```

```
feedback at the end of every session, it’s difficult to imagine ever
working without this.
```
###### *****

## Was it magic?

TEAM therapy sounds so simple when you’re listening to a podcast, or observing a live
treatment session. There are no high technology approaches, and no use of powerful drugs. It
just seems like an interesting conversation. Yet, it’s so powerful, and that’s the essential clue
that there is far more going on.

When TEAM therapy works, it seems like magic. But the only magic that’s occurring is the same
awesome magic that enables wounds to heal, hearts to keep beating day in and day out, the
energy of sunlight to be converted by plants into the foodstuffs on which all forms of life
ultimately depend, and every other wonder in our daily lives.

It is the magic of the world working properly. What the years of work with thousands of patients
has led to is the discovery of powerful techniques that enable our brains to do their jobs. The
magic feeling of rapid emotional change is a magic that we all experience but usually pay little
attention to. The generation of different emotions when our interpretations change is simply
what our brains are designed to do. The magic of TEAM therapy is to help that journey proceed
the way it is meant to.

In the end, the key to understanding TEAM therapy is that it’s good science and good medicine.
The magic is the magic of biology, and the job of the healer is to enable biology to do its job.
TEAM therapy does this effectively, and has much to teach us, not only about how to treat
emotional maladies, but also about the most fundamental aspects of how our brains work.

## Part III: Additional information on twelve frequently asked questions

## 1. Can I skip over any of the parts of TEAM therapy?

One of the purposes of this guide is to make it easier to see how the pieces of TEAM therapy fit
together. Every piece has its purpose, and if you leave a piece out then you won’t get the full
benefits of this approach. You may get some useful benefits, but it will be harder to achieve
rapid and complete recovery.

If you’re working with a TEAM therapist, or you are a TEAM therapist, then skipping over any
part of the TEAM structure is weakening the therapy. If you had a bacterial infection, you
wouldn’t say “Well, I really only need to take half the amount of antibiotics because that will work
just as well.” If you had a broken leg, you wouldn’t say “Oh, I really only need a cast to cover
half the break.” If you had a cut, you wouldn’t say “Oh, I just need to put a band-aid on part of
the cut. That will work just as well.” If your roof was leaking you wouldn’t say “It’s fine if we just
fix half of the leak.”

If you’re a client and steps are being skipped, then ask your therapist why and tell them you
want to the full TEAM experience.


If you’re a therapist and you’re skipping steps, then ask yourself why you’re doing this. You’ve
studied TEAM therapy because you’ve seen how powerful it can be. Why are you reducing the
dose of antibiotics, when you know you need the full dose to achieve recovery?

Talking with therapists and clients about this problem, it seems that one part of TEAM therapy
that is often skipped is when a therapist does not insist on the requirement for homework. A
client may say they’re too busy, or they’re too stressed. The therapist may not want to push too
hard, and agrees that the homework can be skipped.

The problem is that if you skip the homework, it’s harder to make rapid progress.

If you’re not making rapid progress, then it’s tempting to stop using the Brief Mood Survey at the
beginning and end of every session. That’s because having quantitative scores that show that
not much is changing can makes the client feel bad about themselves. Could the lack of
change mean that they’re really broken and defective? The therapist may also feel frustrated
and guilty and incompetent, because they’ve been taught that rapid progress is the goal of
TEAM therapy.

Then you each may tell yourself a story that you don’t need the information provided by the
using the Brief Mood Survey at the beginning and end of every session - but that’s a story
you’re creating so that you don’t have to do something that’s causing you to feel unhappy.

The truth is that you need the Brief Mood Survey the most when you’re not making rapid
progress. You need this information the most because this provides the path to improving the
therapy.

If you’re a therapist and have gotten stuck with a patient, then it’s important to be part of a
discussion group with other therapists to look at ideas for how to move forward. There’s a lot to
learn in TEAM therapy, and gaining from the experience of others is just as helpful here as it is
in any other complex discipline.

```
“TEAM-lite” is not as effective as TEAM-full strength. In fact,
”TEAM-lite” should not be considered as TEAM therapy. If any of
the components are left out, what’s left is not TEAM therapy.
```
```
The above idea notwithstanding, incorporating components of
TEAM into other approaches may make them more powerful.
Therapists who do this (and their clients) will likely be pleased with
the outcomes if they incorporate such TEAM components as e.g.,
working on a moment in time, positive reframing, extensive testing,
and end-of-session evaluations. Of these, testing is the most
important. Without it, it’s like traveling somewhere without
accurate information about how far you’ve gone, how much further
you need to go, how much fuel is left or even whether you’re going
in the right direction.
```
```
Achieving complete recovery over a relatively short time-span,
however, requires using every component of TEAM therapy.
```
## 2. Are there differences between working on depression and anxiety?

Treatment of depression and anxiety by TEAM therapy has many similarities, but there are also
some additional challenges that need to be addressed in many people with anxiety-related
problems.


If you’re interested in anxiety, in yourself or others, there’s a great resource available in the
book _When Panic Attacks_ , which was written by Dr. Burns in 2006. This book benefitted from
25 years of additional experience since the writing of _Feeling Good_ , including multiple other
books, years of research, and thousands of treatment sessions. Several of the most important
advances in TEAM therapy (e.g., the focus on a single moment, positive reframing) are already
present in _When Panic Attacks_. Some of these ideas are still further refined in _Feeling Great._
For example, the importance of early use of positive reframing had not yet been recognized
when Dr. Burns wrote his book on treating anxiety. Nonetheless, _When Panic Attacks_ provides
a detailed road-map for the treatment of even the most severe forms of anxiety. And, just as for
all the books by Dr. Burns, it’s written to be useful for anyone in need.

One of the challenges in treating many types of anxiety is the importance of identifying _hidden
emotions._ These are emotions that may not seem of particular importance when you’re telling
your story, but that are critical targets for enabling effective treatment of anxiety.

A second challenge in treating anxiety is that the only way to cure anxiety quickly is to use some
form of exposure therapy. The most critical principle in carrying out exposure is a simple one,
which is that if you expose yourself to whatever you fear, you’ll find that there’s nothing there to
harm you. There are multiple different ways of doing this, including gradual exposure, jumping
right in to the most frightening circumstances you can imagine with intense exposure (a
technique called flooding), not allowing yourself to respond (a technique called prevention), and
distraction. All of these are discussed in Part III of _When Panic Attacks_ and in _Feeling Great,_
pgs. 272-274 and 488-491. In addition, exposure techniques are discussed in the podcast at
https://feelinggood.com/2017/03/06/026-scared-stiff-the-exposure-model-part-4/.

For some people, gradual exposure is the most useful technique, and it’s one that’s easy to use
even if you’re not working with a therapist. With this technique you describe what most frightens
you and then make a list of small steps to take towards confronting that fear. For each step,
spend 15-20 minutes a day letting it bother you, and you’ll quickly find that the anxiety
associated with that step disappears. When that happens, you then move on to the next
frightening step and do the same thing, until you’ve conquered your fear. For examples of how
to use gradual exposure, see _When Panic Attacks,_ pgs. 254- 257.

If you want more rapid change, however, then intensive exposure (i.e., flooding) is the way to
achieve this. Flooding techniques are one of the most dramatic ways to create an “Aha”
moment, where your problem can suddenly melt away, leaving you wondering why you’d been
so frightened.

It’s also important to stress that there are other interesting medication-free approaches to
treating anxiety-related problems. They’re not as rapid as TEAM therapy, but they can be worth
a look. I particularly recommend the work of Dr. Judson Brewer, which can be found at
drjud.com. His approaches are actually very aligned with many of the ideas of TEAM therapy
discussed in this guide.

**3. Can TEAM therapy be used for other problems, like relationships, addictions and**

##### unhealthy habits?

TEAM therapy is successfully used for the treatment of relationship problems, addictions,
unhealthy habits, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, borderline
personality disorder and many other problems.


For any of these challenges, specialized techniques will be used. Some of these are described
in _Feeling Great_. For relationship problems, the book _Feeling Good Together_ is a critical
resource. The book _Ten Days to Self-Esteem_ was written by Dr. Burns for use in a program
where he was treating many people with borderline personality disorder.

The easiest way to find out more about any problem that interests you is to use the search
function at [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com) to find podcasts that address your interests.

## 4. Does TEAM therapy work for everybody?

As with all of the questions I’m considering, it’s important to be specific.

All of the following thoughts are in respect to full-strength TEAM therapy ((See Questions 1 and
5 ). Effectiveness will be decreased if someone leaves off testing, or homework, or exposure for
anxiety, or any of the other steps discussed in this guide. If the person-in-need commits to doing
TEAM CBT homework (e.g., with the DML) for 20-30 minutes a day for several weeks, the odds
of recovery are so high that the research of Dr. Burns suggests every person is likely to
experience striking improvements. The odds of recovery are also improved by working with a
skilled therapist (but you still have to do the homework to practice new habits of thought). The
specific needs of each person are also relevant, of course.

The first question is what does it mean for a therapy for depression or anxiety “to work.” How
much of a recovery counts as “working?” How fast does the recovery need to be to count as
“working?”

The goal in TEAM therapy is to achieve complete recovery, which is quite a different goal from
other therapies:

- It’s standard practice in treatment of depression or anxiety to consider a 50-60%
    reduction in symptoms (i.e., negative emotions) as a success, even if the reduction is
    restricted to a subset of negative emotions.
- In contrast, the goal in TEAM therapy is to achieve complete, or almost complete,
    reduction in negative emotions in multiple categories.
- It’s also standard practice with other treatments not to even score happiness (i.e.,
    positive emotions).
- TEAM therapists have a goal of also increasing happiness. As discussed in this guide, a
    decrease in negative feelings does not guarantee an increase in positive feelings. For
    TEAM therapists, a failure to improve in positive feelings would be a clear indication that
    there is more work to do.

The goals regarding the speed of recovery also differ in TEAM therapy as compared with other
therapies:

- Some TEAM therapists frequently can provide complete recovery in a few weeks of
    treatment (so long as the client is going to do their homework).
- Having such rapid outcomes requires a great deal of skill and experience, however, so a
    more realistic question would be to ask what are the goals of TEAM therapy as
    compared with other approaches to psychotherapy, use of medications, or both.
- The expectation with other approaches to treating depression or anxiety is that
    treatments will continue for multiple months or, frequently, multiple years.
- The goal of TEAM therapists is to complete treatment within a few months and, if
    possible, within a few weeks. (This assumes, again, that the person being treated does
    all their homework.) Considering that more than 50% of people who did the exercises in
    _Feeling Good_ for four weeks as their sole treatment recovered so much that no other


```
treatment was needed^14 , it seems that a goal of recovery in a few weeks can be
achieved by a high proportion of people (if they do the homework!).
```
- It is possible to achieve even more rapid recovery, as evidenced in the live session
    podcasts at [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com). Most (but not all) of the people treated in these
    sessions have some (or a lot of) familiarity with TEAM therapy, however, which may be
    helpful. (If that is the case, then reading this _User’s Guide_ and gaining some familiarity
    with TEAM therapy will hopefully help increase the speed of recovery for many people.)

With the above stipulations, the next question is whether TEAM therapy works for all disorders
of thinking. The answer is that this is not yet known, but we can make some inferences from
studies on CBT.

As TEAM therapy was designed to be more effective than CBT, it’s reasonable to suggest it will
be useful in all situations where clinical studies of CBT have shown benefits. These include, for
example:

- Addiction
- Anxiety
- Borderline personality disorder^15
- Chronic Pain
- Depression
- Disease-associated depression and anxiety
- Unhealthy Habits
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder
- Panic disorder
- Pediatric depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, etc.
- Phobias
- Post-partum depression
- Post-traumatic stress disorder
- Suicidal intent

From previous work with CBT, we might also conclude that this approach won’t cure
schizophrenia but can help schizophrenics lead happier lives by learning new ways to think
about the voices they might hear. For people with bipolar depressive disorder, the conclusion
seems to be that benefits can be high for the depressive phase and that the manic phase
requires medication. For narcissism, the question is whether the narcissist is willing to admit
that there are problems in their lives that they are causing (in contrast with the more prevalent
view in narcissism that all their problems are the fault of others). For people, including children,
with autism, this approach seems to be helpful in dealing with anxiety and also with getting an
improved understanding of other people.

Another way to be more specific is to ask whether TEAM therapy as practiced by most
therapists works for everybody. It’s routine for TEAM therapists to find that the speed of
recovery of their clients improves as they become more experienced. Talking with therapists
about these changes in the speed of recovery, the feeling is that the difference is due to

(^14) These studies are summarized in _Feeling Great_ , pgs. 465-466.
(^15) In specific respect to the important category of borderline personality disorder (BPD), it’s
worth pointing out that multiple aspects of TEAM therapy were developed in specific response
to the challenges of treating BPD. Recognition also needs to be given to the work of Marsha
Linehan, who developed Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) as another approach to treating
the rapid emotional changes that can make life so challenging for people with BPD.


changes in their skill level and not in a change in their client base. This seems an interesting
observation, as it’s not something you would expect to hear from a therapist who thinks that
treating clients for years is just how therapy works. It’s also interesting that it seems very
unlikely that a TEAM therapist will ever use the phrase, frequently used in the medical
profession, that “the patient failed therapy.” The ethos of TEAM therapy is that if recovery is not
occurring, then the therapy (and the therapist) is failing the patient, and the explicit goal is do
better for the person-in-need.

There’s also another way of thinking about this question that is related to the concept that there
are no therapies that work for everyone. So, let’s set a more realistic goal.

Let’s say TEAM CBT works for 75% of people who try it. The numbers seem to be higher than
that, but 75% is enough to make the point. If your choice was between the following two
options, which would you prefer?

```
Ø A therapy where there was a 75% chance of benefit, with no side effects, where you
could see benefits quickly, that could also give you the tools to prevent relapses, that
can be personalized to your individual needs, and that you could use on your own
```
```
versus
```
```
Ø A therapy with a lower chance of benefit, a risk of side effects, where whatever benefits
occur often don’t occur for weeks (at least), where the odds of any particular drug
working are not high, where the odds of relapse seem to be high and that you cannot
use on your own.
```
## 5. Do I have to do homework?

( _Make sure the read the answer to the next question also.)_

One of the most important factors that will influence your speed of recovery, and the change in
your scores between sessions, is how much homework you do. The homework makes an
enormous difference in the speed of recovery.

In fact, when Dr. Burns studied the question of what was the most important predictor of rapid
recovery (or, indeed, of any recovery at all), it was whether or not someone did their homework.
If you want to speed up your recovery, make sure to do your homework. (See _Feeling Great_ ,
pg. 462 for more information on this topic.)

So, yes, you have to do homework. If you’re going to obtain the benefits of TEAM therapy, this
is not negotiable.

If you want to learn to play tennis, or a musical instrument, or a new language, you have to
practice. With TEAM therapy, you’re building new habits of thinking. Doing this requires
repetition – just like achieving your current state of unhappiness required years of repetition of
errors in your thinking. The good news is that using TEAM therapy to learn patterns of thought
that will enable your happiness can happen fairly quickly. Much more quickly, in fact, than
learning to play tennis, a musical instrument or a new language.

## 6. What kind of homework works best?

There are many different ways to approach homework. In general, if you’re modifying your
nerve cell networks in ways that increase your positive feelings, then you’re on the right track.


That’s a pretty non-specific answer, however, so let’s look a bit deeper. All of these approaches
make sense, and you can also mix them up if you want. You don’t have to stay with just one
approach. That said, bringing curiosity and awareness to the mixture – as discussed in this
section - is always a good idea.

One possibility is to pay attention to the emotions you have after you’ve done the homework,
because the last emotions we have about something are the ones that have the greatest
impression on us. Positive emotions will motivate you to move towards something, and to
repeat experiences that let you feel good. Negative emotions will motivate you to move away
from something and to avoid experiences that make you feel bad. Thus, if you plan your
homework so that you’ll end up feeling better about yourself (i.e., experiencing positive
emotions), then you’re learning that homework is something that feels good to do.

Thinking of homework in the above way, several ideas come to mind:

- Homework focused entirely on identifying negative thoughts may not be enjoyable
    because you’re writing down the beliefs that cause your negative emotions. (See the
    next paragraph after these bullet points, however, for another way to think about this.)
- It might be more enjoyable if you structure the homework so that you always include
    positive reframing, and you conclude by identifying beautiful things about you revealed
    by your negative thoughts and feelings.
- If you combine positive reframing with identification of cognitive distortions, then you can
    feel even better because you’re finding ways in which the negative thoughts are flawed.
    You can feel that even though you make mistakes in your thinking, that’s okay because
    you can recognize the mistakes and correct them.
- In contrast, if you just combine identification of negative thoughts with identification of
    cognitive distortions, this may work for you or it may not. This strategy is the way CBT
    homework sessions have been structured for many years. However, incorporation of
    positive reframing has been critical in making TEAM therapy as powerful as it is.

Another powerful strategy is to incorporate the positive emotions of awareness and curiosity
right from the beginning of every homework session. Now you can take information that feels
negative and experience it in a different way. If you’re writing down your negative thoughts, for
example, and interpret doing this as showing many things that are wrong about you then you
may end up feeling worse about yourself. You can approach this in a different way, however,
and use this exercise as a way to become aware of your internal stories. You can be curious
about what these stories are. You might be curious about identifying pieces of the story you did
not know about before. You can then be curious about where these ideas come from, and why
you believe them, and whether they’re accurate.

If you do something during your homework that’s particularly painful, you can treat this as a clue
that reveals something that may speed your progress on the road to joy. And always remember
that the pain that you feel is just nerve cells firing. Our limbic system does not do a good job of
distinguishing real events from events in your imagination. It’s like imagining that you hit your
thumb with a hammer. That sounds pretty painful, and maybe your imagination is so good that
you can even feel the pain. Still, it’s just nerve cells firing. There’s no hammer. Your thumb is
fine. As soon as you stop thinking about it the pain will go away.

If you’re doing homework every day and it’s not helping you, it’s likely that you need to
incorporate methods into the homework. If you’re working with a therapist, talk with them with to
explore methods you can try. If you’re working by yourself, there’s descriptions of 50 different
methods in _Feeling Great._ You can also find detailed information on most methods by
searching for the method by name on the [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com) podcast website.


There are so many tools in the TEAM toolkit that you can almost always discover methods you
haven’t tried before. It’s the experience of most people that once they find the right method,
then recovery will follow.

## 7. How much homework do I need to do?

If you’re depressed or anxious, then it’s almost certain that you’re spending a fair amount of
time each day thinking about whatever is upsetting do. You’re also likely to be doing things (like
watching television, or playing video games) to distract you from whatever is upsetting you.

Here’s a bigger better offer for you: Take part of that time each day and use it for therapy
homework. Why? Because doing the homework is going to improve your life. Worrying,
watching television, playing video games and other activities like this is not going to improve
your life. Does improving your emotional life seem to you to be a bigger better offer?

Most people seem to do homework for 15-20 minutes a day. If you structure your homework to
make sure that you’re practicing your “personal micro-neurosurgery” and modifying specific
nerve cell networks, then you may even benefit from 10 minutes a day of practicing your new
skills. Such practicing is the goal of homework, so that these new patterns of thought become
habits of thought that are part of your fast thinking response.

## 8. Does TEAM therapy work if I use Feeling Great without a therapist?

The answer to this is not yet known for _Feeling Great_ , but previous studies with _Feeling Good_
suggest this is very likely to be beneficial. The exercises in _Feeling Good_ were so well designed
that others began conducting experiments examining the effects of doing these exercises for
four weeks, in patients with clinical levels of depression. The results were striking, and more
than half of the people using this book benefited so much that they didn’t require any additional
treatment. Moreover, when examined three years later, people were still healthy, and if they felt
down they just used the techniques in _Feeling Good_ again. These studies, led by Dr. Forrest
Scogin, are summarized in _Feeling Great_ , pgs. 465-466.

## 9. Is brain function as simple as it’s described in this guide?

It’s possible to write about a great deal more complexity in the brain, and also to write in a far
more complex manner. The brain is a complicated tissue, with thousands of papers published
every year on different aspects of brain function. There are many studies on aspects of brain
function that excellent scientists think are relevant to understanding depression, anxiety, and
many other emotional challenges.

The problem is that it’s not clear which additional aspects of brain function will help understand
the fundamental challenge to neuroscience posed by the successes of TEAM therapy. How is it
possible for someone who has not benefited from years (or decades) of other therapies,
including medications, be successfully treated in a single two-hour session of TEAM therapy
with Dr. Burns, or in a few sessions with multiple other TEAM therapists? Understanding the
answer to this question strikes me as one of the most profound questions in all of neuroscience,
which is why I began trying to understand this problem.

My own approach to trying to understand the neuroscience underlying TEAM therapy began
with three fundamental rules:


- Start from simple principles that have been rigorously tested and have held up for a long
    time.
- Introduce additional complexity only when it’s required.
- Only introduce complexity that offers testable hypotheses _and_ that helps you better
    understand whatever problem you’re working on.

The reason it’s important to start from well-tested principles is because most scientific ideas turn
out to be wrong (usually in the sense that they’re a step to a more accurate idea), but it takes
time to find out which ones are wrong. In physics, it takes about 45 years for about half of the
ideas that are treated as facts to turn out to be wrong. In psychology, the time is even shorter –
and it’s only a little over 7 years before half of what are thought of as facts turn out to be wrong.

The ability to keep testing ideas, finding out which ones are wrong and moving on to a more
useful analysis is the reason science continues to change and grow and become more powerful.
There are a lot of ideas that look attractive - but most of them don’t last very long as they
continue to be tested and the specific predictions they make turn out to be wrong as science
progresses further.^16 If an idea doesn’t hold up, it gets replaced by a more powerful one.
The short half-life of ideas in psychology creates a major challenge to understanding the
neuroscience of successful treatment, because the foundation for your hypotheses is likely to be
overthrown in the relatively near future. Where then is the safe harbor from which to start this
journey?

Fortunately, the fact that most ideas end up being wrong doesn’t mean that’s always the case.
Some scientific ideas are so insightful that no matter how often they’re tested, they keep making
correct predictions. For example, Archimedes’ discovery that you can calculate the volume of
an irregular object by measuring how much liquid it displaces allows you to make predictions
that are as accurate today as they were in ancient Greece.

If you start out with simple principles that make specific predictions and that have held up under
repeated testing for many years, you’re starting your explorations from a strong foundation.

In psychology, the idea that our emotions come from our interpretations of the world, rather than
the events that happen, has been tested over and over for nearly three thousand years.
Several hundred years before the Buddha, the great thinkers of India had been working on this
problem. Their discoveries led to the development of analytical meditation, which has principles
strikingly like cognitive and behavioral therapy (CBT). The same is true for the Stoic
philosophers of ancient Greece. These ideas continued to be tested by great thinkers of

(^16) This is a very different concept than the reason why ideas can be long-lived in religions.
Scientific ideas have to be testable, which means that there’s a way that they can be shown to
be wrong. In addition, the validity of scientific beliefs is independent of the personal beliefs of
the person testing them. No matter your gender, age, spiritual or political beliefs, if you conduct
the experiment in the same way you’ll get the same answer. Core principles of religions, in
contrast, are matters of personal belief that cannot be tested and thus cannot be shown to be
wrong. In fact, it’s central to a religion that its core beliefs are stated in such a way that they
can’t be shown to be wrong, or else that religion would be at risk of disappearing. This is
particularly true for claims about deities.
This is actually an interesting difference from Buddhism, which in many ways functions more
like a branch of science (and, particularly, a branch of psychology). Buddhist leaders teach that
the Buddha said it’s important for others to test his teachings, and to reject them if they were
wrong. Moreover, Buddhism differs from religions in that Buddhism does not place importance
on the existence of gods or goddesses, and principles of Buddhism do not depend on believing
in such deities.


different times and places. Although it’s correct that Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck (and David
Burns) played critical roles in the development of CBT, they all have recognized that the core
principles of this discipline have roots that extend far into the past. Moreover, the core principles
developed so long ago have proven so profound that, like the discoveries of Archimedes, they
remain unchanged.

In order for TEAM therapy (and CBT in general) to be able to treat the wide range of emotional
maladies for which they’re used, these approaches must work on principles of brain function so
fundamental that they apply to many different situations. Moreover, there do not appear to be
any cultural limitations in utility of the techniques of CBT, so it’s important to start at a basic level
that lets us eliminate differences that might be caused by gender, race, culture or anything else
that varies in different patient populations. If our goal is to generate an understanding of
psychotherapy that’s going to be useful in different people, cultures and times, then it’s
necessary to focus on brain functions that transcend such limitations.

How much does it change any of the suggestions in this guide to know that different regions of
the prefrontal cortex have different functions, that there are multiple other brain regions that are
interesting in depression and anxiety, or that each neurotransmitter can bind to several different
kinds of proteins? If you’re trying to figure out the details of brain function, then this information
is interesting. Yet, even though I’m interested in this level of detail, and can think of a large
number of experiments it would be interesting to conduct, I’m not yet convinced that such
information will cause a fundamental change in the framework that I’m proposing. (I have no
doubt that some of my colleagues in the world of neuroscience will be eager to tell me why I’m
wrong about this. I’m looking forward to their criticisms and their thoughts about insights that
are particularly helpful in understanding how high-speed medication-free psychotherapy works,
particularly in patients for whom medications have failed to provide benefit even after years of
treatment.)

## 10. What about medications?

First, I want to stipulate that nothing that I say in this section should be construed as medical
advice. I am a scientist, and not a doctor. If you’re taking medications, or thinking about taking
medications, this is something you should discuss with your doctor.

It’s clear that TEAM therapy is a different process than a medication-based solution to
depression and anxiety. We considered some of these differences earlier in the _User’s Guide_ ,
but there are still others to consider. For example:

- In most cases, there is no need to use medications in TEAM therapy. Many therapists
    actually find they make successful treatment more difficult. This is true for depression,
    and is even more the case for anxiety.
- In fact, many of the podcasts you can listen to involve people who were treated with
    drugs and other therapies for years before coming to Dr. Burns. This is also true for
    many of the cases discussed in _Feeling Great_ and other books by Dr. Burns. Despite
    years, or even decades, of previous lack of recovery, all of these people were
    successfully treated with TEAM therapy without medications.
- TEAM therapy is also built on the principle of solving specific problems. Medications, in
    contrast, flood your body with chemicals. This is part of the reason for many of the side
    effects of medications, because the chemicals that are being changed play many roles in
    our bodies. In addition, medications don’t teach you anything about the specific reasons
    for your unhappiness.
- As we’ve discussed in this guide, TEAM therapy is based on the idea that your
    unhappiness is revealing what’s right about you. Medications are based on the belief


```
that there is something fundamentally wrong with you. These views help create very
different internal stories. The internal story that goes with medications is that you’re
fundamentally sick and defective. The internal story that goes with TEAM therapy is that
you’re fundamentally fine but you need to learn some new thinking skills.
```
It's also necessary to ask the question about how helpful medications are (as compared with
placebo effects). A large number of scientific studies indicate that the percentage of people
helped by antidepressants is very similar to the percentage helped by placebos.

For drug therapy, there is a lot of contradictory information available:

- You’ll encounter some sites that tell you great things about drugs and how beneficial
    they are.
- You can also find information from people who found drugs were very helpful for them.
- You’ll find information from other people claiming that drugs don’t work well at all.
- You’ll also find many thoughtful criticisms of the idea that depression and anxiety are
    caused by chemical imbalances.
- You’ll find a lot of information about side effects of different drugs, including people
    describing their personal experiences.
- You’ll also find many studies that claim that drugs are no more effective than placebos
    (i.e., sugar pills), except that the placebos don’t have the side effects.

It’s easy to be overwhelmed by all the information that’s available. In addition, we’re exposed a
lot to the idea that chemical imbalances are important in depression and anxiety, but that
doesn’t mean this idea is correct. Drugs are easy to prescribe, and their use fits with our
internal stories that the way to treat a medical problem is with a drug. In addition, there are
many companies that make enormous amounts of money by encouraging people to buy
antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs. In contrast, there are no companies making money
from TEAM therapy or other types of CBT. As you can see, there are multiple reasons why
believing that drugs are useful for treating depression and anxiety is part our internal stories.

It’s hard to figure out what interpretations are most likely to be correct when you can find
information to support any belief that fits with your internal stories. What can you do?

The question of how well the use of medications for depression and anxiety is scientifically
supported is discussed in _Feeling Great_ Chapter 31 and in multiple [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com)
podcasts (including podcasts 20, 89, 90 and 218). In addition, the following reading may be of

whitaker-1.2667410


Despite the above concerns, it’s clear that some people can feel much better when taking the
correct dose of their prescribed anti-depressants or anti-anxiety drugs. If you are among those
who have found antidepressants to be an unequivocal benefit, nothing that is said in this guide
is intended to argue against your continued use of such medications.

Many people do not feel the way they want to when taking these medications, however, or they
experience side effects that they do not like, and therefore are seeking different treatment
options. For many people, more medications are added on and doses get increased. That’s
not been a successful paradigm.

Another problem is that some people can feel pretty awful for a little while when they’re stopping
antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications, and it is recommended to come off them slowly
and with the support of a medical professional. It’s totally normal to feel poorly when stopping
your antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication, and it doesn’t mean anything is wrong with you.
It just means your brain is resetting itself for normal function. You and your TEAM therapist can
use the techniques discussed in this guide to help you with that transition.

If you’re using antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs, and you want to stop, talk about this with
your therapist and the doctor/psychiatrist who prescribed them. The techniques of TEAM
therapy can help you through this process. Even if you are happy with your medication regimen
right now, TEAM therapy can help boost your recovery and potentially offer you the opportunity
to come off medications (if that is a desired goal for you).

The topic of whether depression and anxiety might be caused by organic problems in brain
function will take a lot of space to explore in detail. There are a lot of questions on this topic that
I hope to write about in the future.

At the moment, here are some additional thoughts about these questions:

- As discussed earlier, TEAM CBT is used to treat many individuals for whom different
    drugs and other therapeutic approaches have failed to provide benefit for years, or even
    for decades. That suggests that whatever TEAM CBT does is more powerful than the
    effects of, e.g., drugs that modulate levels of chemicals in the brain.
- There is also a general concern that relates to the topic of treating specific issues (which
    I think of in terms of specific patterns of thought and networks of nerve cells) versus
    treatments that flood the body on a more general level. As an analogy I don’t think it’s a
    sensible approach to turn off the electricity for the whole city just to turn off a light in one
    room of one home in that city. For me, that analogy helps illuminate important
    differences between medication-based approaches and the specific nature of TEAM
    CBT (and other forms of CBT, as well as aspects of Stoic and Buddhist philosophies).
- There’s another concern about specificity, which relates to the ability to distinguish signal
    from noise. For example, let’s say that the current view is right that dopamine is an
    important part of how the brain creates a sense of positive anticipation. In normal brain
    function, that anticipation is to something very specific happening (e.g., seeing someone
    you like or love, eating a piece of chocolate, listening to music, etc.). The release of
    dopamine increases joyful anticipation of that specific event. Those specific events are
    the signals. Just generally increasing dopamine levels doesn’t teach you anything about
    specific life events – it’s more like taking cocaine or any other transient inducer of
    general happiness. It does not help you create an improved way of interacting with the
    world. Instead, it seems like what it does is increase the background noise and make it
    difficult to identify the specific signals.


- The above concern applies to every neuromodulator, and reveals a stark difference
    between the understanding of brain function useful in explaining the efficacy of TEAM
    Therapy and the understanding of brain function that researchers apply to the
    investigation of drug-based therapies. The whole basis of TEAM Therapy (and of all
    CBT) is specificity. The whole basis of drug-based therapies is that treatment requires
    flooding the system.
- It’s also important to remember that the interpretation of the action of every neuro-
    chemical that’s been studied has already gone through multiple changes to reach the
    current interpretations as to what it does. At each previous step in this process, people
    were just as confident that they had the “correct” understanding of what that chemical
    does as they are today. What are the odds that what we think is a “correct”
    understanding is going to change again? Historically, you’d have to conclude those
    odds are pretty high.
       The still changing understanding of the role of different neurotransmitters in
    emotional regulation seems like a shakier foundation on which to build hypotheses than
    the view of brain function that emotions are based on our interpretations of events. The
    discovery that our emotions are a consequence of our interpretations seems to have
    held up just as well as, e.g., the discovery by Archimedes that you can tell the volume of
    a solid by measuring how much water it displaces. In contrast, ideas on the role of
    specific neurotransmitters in understanding emotions seem to be changing every few
    years.
- Nonetheless, there is a chance here to test specific hypotheses about, e.g.,
    neurotransmitter levels, or other aspects of brain function and their relationships to
    depression and anxiety. If someone wanted to rigorously test their hypotheses about the
    importance of changes in, e.g., dopamine levels or interactions between the amygdala
    and the prefrontal cortex, they could work with a skilled TEAM therapist and arrange to
    take whatever measures they wanted before and after therapy. If a person showed
    excellent recovery (based on describing their emotional state,) and these other
    measures changed according to current predictions, that would be interesting. If the
    emotional state changed and the other measures did not change, then we’d have to
    consider the possibility that the other measures do not mean what people think they
    mean.
- This ability to test specific hypotheses also applies to the use of such drugs as ketamine,
    ayahuasca, psilocybin and other agents being examined as part of treatments for
    depression. It is already clear that these drugs need to be given in the context of a
    structured therapeutic setting to increase the possibility of therapeutic utility. Moreover,
    the ability of some of these drugs to help people re-think their interpretations of the world
    seems very similar to what happens in TEAM Therapy. In fact, Dr. Burns has spoken on
    multiple podcasts about the frequency with which people who achieve rapid recovery
    experience sensations of bliss and enlightenment – sensations that often are associated
    with some of these drugs. Some TEAM therapists are also trained in ketamine therapy,
    for example, and it will be interesting to see how these two approaches might interact. It
    seems a rational hypothesis to suggest that, at a minimum, the use of TEAM Therapy
    approaches, including (and especially?) the DML might make these other therapies
    much more effective.

```
*****
```
There’s another approach to thinking about this problem that I think deserves some
consideration, which has to do with something called the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The
NNT is the number of patients that you need to treat to see an improvement compared to the


effects of a placebo^17. For example, let’s say you’re testing a drug and find that 50% of patients
get benefit from an inert placebo and 60% of patients get benefit from the drug you’re testing.
To oversimplify somewhat, that would mean you need to treat 6 patients to see one real
response (i.e., a response that you didn’t get with a placebo). In this case, your NNT would be
6.

This is a very important issue in respect to evaluating drugs used for depression and anxiety, as
medications do not outperform placebo by very much, if at all (as discussed in _Feeling Great_ ,
Chapter 31).

There are shortcomings with using the NNT to evaluate efficacy because you have to further
define the extent of recovery that you’ll use in your calculations. What’s the comparison
between a 50% recovery and a full recovery? Do both count equally? How quickly does the
response occur? How long does the response last?

If the difference between placebo and medication is not large, which appears to be the case for
antidepressants and drugs used to treat anxiety, then the NNT will be large. While you can’t
really do a placebo study with something like TEAM therapy, you can compare it with other
therapies. This is in fact what is going on when someone who has received no benefit from
other types of therapy, including medications, is treated with TEAM therapy. This is the most
difficult treatment situation imaginable, as these are people for whom nothing else has worked.
Yet, TEAM therapists routinely treat people for whom other therapies did not work, and TEAM
therapy is so successful in these circumstances that the NNT looks like it would be under 2, and
potentially pretty close to 1 (which is a perfect score).

**11. Does the success of TEAM therapy mean that depression and anxiety are “all in your**

##### head?”

We discussed on Podcast 275 the concern that people might misunderstand TEAM therapy,
and the ability to obtain high-speed medication-free recovery as indicating that depression,
anxiety and related problems are somehow not “real” problems. Nothing could be further than
the truth. Depression and anxiety steal the joyful life of millions upon millions of people, and
these are very serious issues.

The way that I think about this question, which I mentioned in the podcast, is that the medical
profession mistreated stomach ulcers for a very long time. Ulcers were considered to be a
psychological problem, or they were treated by dietary regimens of various sorts. The discovery
that stomach ulcers could be caused by infection with the bacterium H. pylori ushered in a new
era of rapid treatment with antibiotics. But that doesn’t mean that ulcers don’t really exist as a
medical problem. Similarly, the fact that headaches respond to simple anti-pain medications
(such as aspirin) does not mean headaches don’t really exist.

From my current perspective, it seems that the most urgent questions may be to find out what
proportion of people with depression and anxiety benefit from TEAM therapy and to develop
ways of making this approach more widely available (such as the app being developed by Dr.
Burns and his colleagues, as discussed in https://feelinggood.com/2020/02/17/180-feeling-
great-the-book-and-the-app/ ). Then we can ask the question of how to better treat individuals
who are not responsive to TEAM therapy. CBT is already considered to be the front-line

(^17) A brief overview on the meaning of the NNT can be found at
https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/assessment/research-methods-statistics/numbers-needed-
treat-harm-nnt-nnh-statistics-tell/


treatment for anxiety and depression^18 , and TEAM therapy looks like it is considerably more
powerful than traditional CBT.

**12. Are there any publications on analysis of TEAM therapy treatments in the scientific**

##### literature?

Dr. Burns and his colleagues are currently in the midst of analyzing large amounts of data on
TEAM therapy. He has an outstanding record of past publications of CBT, and therapists
working with TEAM therapy are enthusiastic about these analyses. Information will be provided
at [http://www.feelinggood.com](http://www.feelinggood.com) as soon as it becomes available.

## Additional resources

_Feeling Great_ is the latest book by David Burns, and is a self-help book for people who want to
use the techniques that are used by TEAM therapists. It can be used with a therapist, or by
yourself. The same is true for other books by Dr. Burns, beginning with _Feeling Good._ These
books are on such topics as anxiety ( _When Panic Attacks_ ), social anxiety ( _Intimate
Connections_ ), self-esteem ( _Ten Days to Self-Esteem_ ), relationships ( _Feeling Good Together_ ).
More information on all the books by Dr. Burns can be found at https://feelinggood.com/books/.

More information on TEAM therapy is available for free at Dr. Burns’ website,
[http://www.feelinggood.com.](http://www.feelinggood.com.) You can find weekly podcasts on a wide range of topics, recordings of
live treatment sessions with people facing many different kinds of challenges, tools for dealing
with your own challenges, information on other books by Dr. Burns, and much else.

In addition, _The Antidepressant Book_ , by Dr. Jacob Towery, is an excellent resource for
teenagers interested in learning how to apply the skills of TEAM therapy to their own lives.

For myself, there are many researchers and therapists whose work I have found of great
interest. As a starter, I recommend podcasts/lectures, articles and books by (in alphabetical
order) Lisa Feldman Barrett, Aaron Beck, Judson Brewer, Albert Ellis, Andrew Huberman,
Daniel Kahneman, Jennifer Kolari, George Lakoff, Joseph Ledoux, Gabor Maté, Michael
Rousell, Robert Sapolsky and Julia Shaw.

## Acknowledgements

In addition to his gratitude to David Burns for his warm welcome and constant encouragement,
Dr. Noble is grateful to multiple other colleagues for their help and patience in his efforts to
develop an understanding of TEAM therapy from the perspective of brain function. Discussions
with Margot Mayer-Proschel, Chris Proschel and Sara Noble have been particularly helpful. He
is immensely grateful to all the members of the TEAM community who have welcomed him into
their world, to the members of the international training group established by Drs. Rhonda
Barovsky, Leigh Harrington and Richard Lam, and to Drs. Barovsky and Harrington, Eva Noble
and Cliff Straehley for their helpful comments on this guide. Illustrations were created by Mark
Noble using ProCreate©.

(^18) That recommendation does not address, however, the need for well-trained therapists, rapid
availability of treatment, coverage by insurance and other issues that make it hard to use CBT
as frequently as is recommended. Such difficulties increase the likelihood that people will be
treated with drugs when they might be much more effectively treated with medication-free
treatments.


## About the author

Dr. Mark Noble is Professor of Genetics and Neuroscience at the University of Rochester
Medical Center. He’s best known for his work as one of the pioneering figures of stem cell
biology. His current laboratory is engaged in development of improved treatments for traumatic
injury to the nervous system, more effective and safer treatments for various types of cancer,
and discovery of new molecular pathways involved in development of the nervous system.

Following disturbing discoveries in his laboratory on the toxicity of some widely used
antidepressants, Dr. Noble reached out to Dr. Burns in 2017 to understand TEAM therapy. After
observing the remarkable changes that occur in high-speed therapeutic sessions, he began
interacting with Dr. Burns and his colleagues to understand how TEAM therapy can produce
such rapid change, even in people for whom other therapeutic approaches failed to provide
benefit for years, or even decades. This work has led to new hypotheses on the neuroscience of
effective psychotherapy, as well as to experiments on molecular aspects of chronic stress that
feed back into Dr. Noble’s research on cellular and molecular approaches to understanding
normal development and treating disease. Additional thoughts on the analysis of TEAM therapy
from the perspective of brain function can be found in podcasts that are part of the free weekly
series provided by Dr. Burns as part of providing training in this therapeutic approach. At Dr.
Burns’ invitation, Dr. Noble also contributed a chapter on the neuroscience of TEAM therapy for
_Feeling Great_.^19
