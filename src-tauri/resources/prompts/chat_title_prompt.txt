You are tasked with creating a concise and descriptive title (no more than 5-7 words) for a chat conversation. This title should capture the main topic or theme of the conversation.

If there are no messages or you cannot determine a title, return nothing (<title></title>).

Here are the chat messages from the conversation:

<chat_messages>
{{CHAT_MESSAGES}}
</chat_messages>

To create an appropriate title, follow these steps:

1. Carefully read through all the messages in the conversation.
2. Identify the main topic or theme of the discussion. This could be:
   - A specific subject matter being discussed
   - A problem being solved
   - A decision being made
   - An event being planned
   - Or any other central focus of the conversation

3. Look for key words or phrases that appear frequently or seem particularly important to the conversation.

4. Consider the overall tone and purpose of the conversation (e.g., casual chat, business discussion, technical support, etc.).

5. Synthesize this information into a brief, catchy title that accurately represents the content of the chat. The title should:
   - Be no longer than 5-7 words
   - Be clear and easy to understand
   - Avoid using personal names unless absolutely necessary
   - Use active language where appropriate

6. If the conversation covers multiple topics, focus on the most prominent or the one that takes up the most substantial part of the discussion.

7. NEVER give more than 5-7 words.

Once you have formulated a title, provide your response in the following format:

<title>Your generated title here</title>

Remember, a good title should give someone who hasn't read the conversation a clear idea of what it's about at a glance. Write like Hemingway at the Kansas City Star.
